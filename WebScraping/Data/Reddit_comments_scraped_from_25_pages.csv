1,ZenonEniotl," Location:Germany Budget:SUB 1500-2000. I've been looking around the used car market,as I'll need one in about a year.. I have very fond memories of my grandfather's Audi 80 and of the Mercedes 190... Both models from the 80s-90s sell at a ""too good to be true price"" often under 1000 euro for either model, in good working condition..... Are those two models known to be unreliable? Were they produced in insane quantities? Why are they so cheap?. Anyone have any experience with them that could tell me whether they're worth their money?. Thanks in advance for any replies!!.

8,ohnoimrunningoutofsp," Any modern car will have ridiculous crash safety ratings. Sure, less so on a smart car or lotus, but 99% of them are great. Are you the parent?. Some like to give the kid a hatchback or SUV for more ""safety"" which is fine. They also need the space for road trips or school. Used rav4 would be a good option. Or some want to give them AWD also but hatchback/sedan? WRX or impreza. Keeps value well too!. If don't need space a civic is a nice option too. If he wants something sportier but not stupid fast, an FRS or BRZ is great.. They're all easy to drive if they're auto. And learning manual is relatively easy anyway. That side, yeah they're all easy to drive, the ones I mentioned anyway. Something like a camaro has crazy bad vision for example.. Seriously, they're all SUPER safe. That's why cars keep getting heavier. Bad for some try hard enthusiasts like me and the 3700lb mustang, but good in general.. edit:i personally dont know which cars have like accident awareness, that can detect if you're gonna hit the car in front of you and brake for you, but generally hard to find i imagine under 20k..

18,ohnoimrunningoutofsp," reliable but fun cars you're looking at japanese ones. cheap, fun and easy to repair would be some american ones. they're generally simpler and less luxury.. so reliable but fun could be like 350z, 370z, frs, brz, civic, corolla, camry, accord (the v6), IS250, IS350, to name a few.. Don't quote me on easy to repair though, I don't repair stuff myself. I just know in general, its easier and cheaper to repair a 2015 mustang GT vs a 2015 340/335i for example. NA (non turbo/supercharged) and rwd/fwd are also cheaper/more reliable. Less components to go wrong compared to AWD i THINK..

24,8260," What are your thoughts about leasing a used car in the $10,000 range?. Long story short it turns out my TL with 130,000 miles didn't have it's Timing Belt replaced properly and frankly I don't want to invest the $1,500 or so it needs in preventative repairs when it's worth about $3,500 at market value.. My commute will also increase from 7 to 30 mins so I can't keep driving a car that gets 16-18MPG on Premium gas.. I considered the possibility of leasing an Accord Sport 2.0t (went as far as test driving one) and then realized that it'd be stupid to lease a 26k car while making 31k.. I tried to get the numbers to work in my mind but at the end of the day I'm taking the face value number of the car and see that it's not a smart purchase.. With that in mind, I've elected to lease a cheaper vehicle. My Acura with its issues won't get me much in a private sale so I'm considering trading it in. and using the car as a down payment on a lease.. Is this wise?.

I really wanted an e46 325-335xi but they're impossible to find and most have extremely high mileage (most are 160,000km+). Audi A4 2009 was a good front runner but they're 2-4k over my budget and they wouldn't be manual.. WRXs are overpriced and really beaten up around here..

45,passionatebat5," Hey guys! I'm starting a new job in a couple of weeks and am looking to lease or buy a CPO car in the bay area. I have been looking at Mercedes c300 and if I lease it, it'll cost me ~$500 per month with amg kit and the best packages. If I have to buy it I will probably go for a 2016 CPO that will cost be probably the same per month for the next 5 years.. I have driven the car and absolutely love it. But my experience of driving or maintaining vehicles is very limited. I came from another country last year where we drove stick and the maintenance cost was dirt cheap as well.. The cost of the car including insurance and gas would be around 16-18% of my monthly income.. I would really appreciate if you guys could comment on this situation or if you have any advice. I'm open to other car suggestions as well. I'm mainly looking at a panaromic roof, heated front seats, blind spot assist and other basic features,. Thanks!.

65,ohnoimrunningoutofsp," So most new cars are stupidly fuel efficient because they're competing so hard in that category. Obviously not a jeep or mustang GT but still MUCH more fuel efficient than their predecessors ever were. Most of it is now down to driving style. Also, any car can have leather and sunroof. So as you can see from my flair, I might be a bit biased, but an interesting option for you would a mustang ecoboost. Pretty fuel efficient but quick when you want it to be. Anyway, that's just a fun option.. You want acceleration and fuel efficient. SUV would be a bit heavier, if fuel efficient is extremely important to you, a lighter car is best. You could get an accord or camry v6. Those are faster than some sports cars, but can still be very fuel efficient. Get a used one, leather and sunroof option, and done.. Although if you want more luxury, lexus is a great way to go. I feel like mazda tries to advertise itself as everything, but doesn't excel at any one thing. They're not the most fuel efficient, not the most luxury, not the most basic, not the quickest, not the best bang for buck. But still people like them so a mazda 2 or mazda 3 could be another option for you.. Well, let me know what you think and maybe we can narrow down some options..

I'm not a fan of the infotainment and I hate the cupholder location in the CX-3. I was looking into the Accords, but I couldn't find any that had leather/lower mileage that were cheaper than Acura..

92,Mikeymike304," Honestly for a practicaly daily driver that is super capable and able do anything you need, there isn't much better than an XC40. You can get the T5 for just 35k and its at the same level of reinfinement of its more expensive german counterparts. You could also look at an XC60 or an alfa romeo stelvio. The later being sportier but still refined. Not as sure on the reliability vs the Volvos though..

93,IKnowNewCars," The XC40 is a nice addition to Volvo's already great crossover line. Opt for a T5 AWD R-Design and you'll get that quick steering and acceleration you're looking for, plus a decently sporty suspension and great look to match. The transmission is well done, though the engine sound is less refined than some of its competitors. The interior is nice, but doesn't hit Volvo's usual upper echelon of quality. Still, you get a lot of style and fun for a sub-$40k luxury crossover.. To me, the XC40's top competitor is the BMW X1. They've done such a great job of combining a great engine, transmission, chassis, and suspension into a crossover that drives almost as nicely as a 3-series but has a decent amount of passenger and cargo space. Opt for an xDrive28i M Sport and you get that upgraded steering and suspension, plus a decent standard feature list (like very comfortable sport seats). The price approaches $42k (before adding additional features and packages, if desired), but while you don't get that signature Volvo style, you get a more well-rounded vehicle courtesy of BMW.. The Lexus NX300 F Sport is a nice alternative if comfort and reliability are your priorities, though it certainly doesn't have the fun-to-drive factor as much as the Volvo or BMW. The 2019 Acura RDX looks like it might be solid, especially with its torque-y new turbo engine and SH-AWD, but how well it's executed is speculation for now. I'd skip the QX30; it's gorgeous and well priced but compromises in a number of places, including a cramped interior.. If you wanna go the wagon route (and I do recommend that folks check it out if they're open to it), the Alltrack is a practical way to make it happen. Decking out an SEL model for $36k will certainly offer a lot of fun, comfort, and practicality. If your budget can handle it, though, I also recommend you check out the Audi A4 Allroad. It combines the practicality of a wagon with a quick 250 HP engine, an awesome 7-speed dual-clutch auto transmission, Audi's great interiors, and a fun driving experience. The starting price is around $45k, and if you want, you can even option a full-paint exterior that swaps out the plastic cladding for a cleaner look overall. Perfect blend of everything you're looking for, in my opinion!. ",Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dxb6owp,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8axmrm/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

I've long considered a cheap miata, because it'd be fun to drive, but worry about maintenance costs (and having a softtop in the NE region in winter).

123,IKnowNewCars," For a non-luxury crossover with a luxury experience, my absolute first thought is the Mazda CX-5. Decking it out with the Grand Touring Trim, AWD, and the Premium Package comes out to $33k MSRP w/ delivery (cheaper than the CR-V Touring), and it has one of the nicest interiors of any crossover in its price range. The CR-V Touring is a great option, of course, but while you get more features, the interior quality just doesn't quite hit the level of the CX-5 for me.. If you go with the Forester, I highly recommend going for the top-level XT Touring trim. Even if she doesn't need the extra speed (and it is the quickest in its class), the turbocharged engine has a lot more accessible torque than the base engine, so maneuvers like passing on the highway are much easier. The selectable drive modes also help the transmission act a bit nicer.. You're looking at $33k for the CX-5 AWD Grand Touring w/ Premium Package, $35k for the CR-V AWD Touring, and $37k for the Forester XT Touring. Each dealership may have different discounts to offer as well. Have her test drive all 3 and pick the one she likes best. You can't go wrong!.

125,IKnowNewCars," Reliability is hard to predict these days. Lots of people go on hearsay and past experiences, but many brands have changed their quality control in recent years (usually for the better), and different models built in different factories can have vastly different longevity. In general, I use Consumer Reports, since their estimates use fairly scientific methodologies: VW's reliability has been slightly below average lately. However, their overall owner satisfaction is above average, and for 2018 they added a new 6 year/72k mile bumper-to-bumper warranty for almost all their new vehicles. Having said that, the 2018 Tiguan got quite a bit bigger than the old one, and thus its driving experience isn't as nice as the previous model. I only really recommend it to folks who need a third row of seats or extra cargo space but can't afford a mid-size SUV/crossover.. Ford reliability and owner satisfaction are average, smack in the middle. Ford's current lineup ranges from fantastic to very mediocre, with the Escape falling in the better half. If she test drives a well-configured model and really likes it, it could be worth the buy. The Titanium trim comes standard with the great 2.0L EcoBoost engine and lots of nice features. Adding the Safe and Smart package for great tech features brings the MSRP to $36k w/ AWD. Like all American brands, Ford is offering tons of incentives and discounts on these cars, so she can expect to pay closer to $32k.. Chevy and GMC both have below average reliability but above average customer satisfaction. The Equinox and Terrain are fine crossovers but not fantastic.. Chrysler's reliability has improved, so it's about average now, and owner satisfaction is higher than before too. On the other hand, Jeep is bottom barrel for reliability, as are most other FCA brands. The 2019 Cherokee looks great, and the Grand Cherokee is always a favorite, but you just have to accept that reliability will not be great if you go that route.. The Korean brands have done well lately. Genesis (Hyundai's new luxury brand) was rated #1 by Consumer Reports overall, with top owner satisfaction and average reliability. Kia was ranked #3 for reliability (right after Toyota and Lexus), and Hyundai was above average..

If you do get a Tercel, and you care whether it uses ignition coils or a distributor, steer clear of any that are older than 96 if you don't want to deal with a distributor.. Also, it uses a physical cable for the speedometer as opposed to an electronic sensor, and they have been known to break, so be aware of that. There's a reason they're cheap, but the engines are solid.. ",Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dx994j6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8axmrm/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
132,dbdango," Hi all. Occasional driver here looking for an upgrade from my 2011 Honda Fit. Bought it in 2013 and have only put about 40k miles on it in the meantime, so don't really want to spend a ton on something that doesn't get used daily. The Fit really meets all my needs, but if I can afford it, I'd like to step up to something sturdier with some quality-of-life improvements. (Thinking about a smooth ride and doors that close softly more than things like rear-view cameras or built-in navigation.) Being winter-ready would be a plus, but not strictly necessary. Have considered options like a VW Golf or Mini Cooper, but haven't really looked too closely yet. Appreciate any suggestions/comments!. Location:Boston area.. Price range:Around $20,000.. Lease or Buy:Buy. New or used:1-2 years used / CPO.. Type of vehicle:Compact, hatchback likely.. Must haves:Fuel efficiency, . smooth ride. .. Desired transmission:Auto only.. Intended use:Weekday errands, weekend trips, and . occasional.  commutes.. Do you need a Warranty:Not necessarily.. Minor/Major work:At a shop, likely the dealer if conveniently located and not outrageously priced..

133,IKnowNewCars," For cars in this price range, the ones that have more lively handling (think Mini Cooper) are less likely to have the smooth ride you're looking for. A Mazda 3, Honda Civic, or VW Golf would have a more comfortable ride than a Mini on average. If fuel efficiency is important, you can see if any 2017 Civic Hatchbacks have shown up used or CPO yet, or a 2016 Civic sedan with the 1.5L turbo engine.. There are tons of used options available to you, so make sure you get some other suggestions, as I tend to focus more on the current model year. But hopefully that's a good place to start!.

135,IKnowNewCars," I'm very glad the Civic Hatch made its way to North America for 2017-2018. It's a very well done chassis, both in terms of practicality and performance.

A4 :9,571 miles, I4 2.0L engine, $23,000. I really like the C350, its definitely the most powerful out of the three, with 302hp and AMG alloy wheels, but the A4 is probably the better deal. The BMW and A4 I think are CPO as well. All are from their respective dealers, no private party. Right now I'm thinking C350 &gt; A4 &gt; 328xi. Location:Midwest USA. Price range:0-$25000.

137,secretagentstv, Looking at German cars? They say Audi is the most reliable. If you are using a loan you should keep in mind cost of the car over the life of the loan is maintenance too.

139,Mikeymike304," So it is and isnt a misconception. It is true if you take your car to BMW etc for its serv/maint. A normal service shop should be pretty similar to any other car. If you do the work yourself it is as cheap as any other car with the possible exception of a part here or there being a little more.. In terms of what to get, the C350 doesn't compete with the BMW and Audi you are looking at. It competes with the 335 and the S4. That is why you will be getting more power. So you will be looking at less power in the other 2 but better mpg. Or you could look for a 335 and s4 and have similar in both.. The difference between the 3 is the C350 have the best interiors, the bmw will have the better driving feel, and (in my opinion) the Audi has the better looks and is in the middle for interior and driving feel.. If you would do anything aftermarket, a tune on either the bmw or Audi would give you better performance than the C350 and should be under $1000.00. The Merc you can't much additional performance out of.. Also is the Audi a quottro or the Merc a 4matic? The BMW has 4 wheel drive which if you live in an area with snow can be a huge plus..

142,IKnowNewCars," For a sub-$100k coupe that blends luxury and performance, here are the ones that come to mind right now: Lexus LC500. Lexus has made a truly special Grand Tourer with this new LC. It's beautiful inside and out, the V8 sounds amazing, the chassis is well done, it's a great package. It's not gonna keep up with an equally-priced 911 on the track, but it's not supposed to. It's fun enough for most folks and it's so luxurious. I'd say it's the closest you can get to an Aston Martin without hitting six figures.. Mercedes-Benz SL450. The SL-class has been the pinnacle of luxury roadsters for decades, and it still holds its own. The only reason it loses out to the LC500 for me is that it's simply an older design that doesn't offer quite as much for the money as the LC:the V6 engine doesn't sound as amazing, the interior has a slightly dated vibe, etc. But it's still classy as hell and worth its $90k price tag for those who want what it has to offer.. Mercedes-Benz E400. If Mercedes offered an E43 coupe (or if they offered a non-S version of the E63 in the US at all), both of those would fit the bill very nicely. But the E400 is very nice for its $60k price tag. It's not as sporty or nimble as some of its competitors, but ride comfort is . very.  nice, and you can still feel the quality in its chassis build and steering.. Mercedes-AMG C63 S. If you wanna lean more towards performance and nimble, sporty handling, but still retain a gorgeous interior and Mercedes style, the C63 S is your answer. $75k for an M4-sized vehicle that does it all, with sharper steering than the M4 and at least as much character.. Once you include the M4, there's also the RC-F, RS5, ATS-V coupe, etc. All awesome cars, but the C63 S has the edge over all of them, in my opinion. Just depends on what you're looking for!. If you want to go all-in on the sporty side of things, a Cayman GTS or a base 911 is certainly hard to beat. Might as well check out the Audi TT RS and Jaguar F-Type too!.

147,Ze_S_Z," Depreciation wise, the Cayman GTS was a good value (way less depreciation and ownership cost than a M3 / M4 or C63, or really any car for that range...) in my area which is why I bought mine. BUT mine is the flat 6 howling flat 6 981. The new 718 with the flat 4 has been depreciating quite a bit more than the old 981 in my area and sells a lot less now too. It's just not as desirable I suppose. So the curve is still unknown, but I'd say it CANT be worse than M3 or C63 which are horrendous depreciation.. ",Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dx886cg,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8axmrm/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
148,IKnowNewCars," I mean, I get why the flat 6 is desirable for enthusiasts looking to buy a Cayman or Boxster used. The sound alone makes a huge difference. But objectively speaking, the performance on the 718 is fantastic, and it's still one of the best sports cars in the world, especially for the money.. For what it's worth, I don't consider deprecation as a super important characteristic when buying new, at least not when it comes to expensive sports cars and luxury cars. Folks who only want to keep the car for a few years can find a good lease deal and not have to worry about selling it. And if you're gonna keep it for a long time, depreciation would be pretty low on the priority list, at least to me.. ",Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dx886cg,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8axmrm/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
149,Ze_S_Z," (I have a depreciation comparison later in the comment) I don't really understand nor follow that logic. Leasing deals are often all very expensive in comparison to cashing out the car then selling It. Unless you can put that money that you save initially into good use that yields higher returns than the saving of cashing it out, I don't see a point in leases.. Secondly i don't know about your financial position (maybe you are much more wealthy) but depreciation and ownership cost IS a very big deal to me and the buyers I've met around me. Plus saving never hurts.. Furthermore, to make the depreciation idea even more drastic, my Cayman was 105k CAD MSRP, it is now (for its condition) on sale by dealerships for 93 to 96k CAD. In comparison to a 110k CAD BMW M4, they are barely listed for 85k in my area although the car was more expensive.. I'm not sure about you, but I certainly care about ownership cost.. ",Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dx886cg,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8axmrm/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
150,IKnowNewCars," It's not purely about logic, believe it or not. Here's a breakdown of how I generally see expensive car buyers: Rich folks who want the newest thing every few years. A lot of these people aren't driving enthusiasts, or even car lovers in the sense that many people on this sub are. They just have lost of money and can afford the fancy stuff. After a few years, they'll be bored with what they have and they'll want the new tech and features. Even if leasing is more expensive, these folks will pay more to lease so they don't have the liability of paying for repairs when expensive tech in the vehicle breaks. They also won't have the responsibility of selling it when they're done with it. These folks tend to lease.. Folks like me who keep a car for a long time, ideally driving it til it dies. Of course less deprecation is better, but if I'm gonna keep a car for 10+ years, I'm not gonna give up a car that's everything I want in a car for one that's less great, just because one will depreciate faster than the other. I want 10 years of driving something I truly love, not 10 years of less enjoyment just so I might get more money if I sell it, which I may never even do.. Car enthusiasts who buy used. There are tons of folks, like many on this subreddit, who would rather spend $50k on a use car that was once $100k and has depreciated a lot than spend it on a new car with less performance, style, character, or uniqueness. Those folks don't care about depreciation because depreciation is the only reason they were able to buy that car in the first place.. If you buy new, depreciation only truly matters if you plan on selling the car or if the car is totaled in an accident. Or if you place great importance on your bottom-line net worth, for some reason. If you're the kind of person who buys very expensive cars new and sells them a few years later, and does this frequently without buying used, I'd say you are in the minority.. I love cars, but I've also been dealing with debt and getting back on my feet for a while now. The car I drive is 16 years old. There are 90s Honda Civics out there worth more than the value of my car. But I love driving it, so I'm gonna keep driving it until I'm in a place where I can afford something I really love. When that time comes, of course I'm gonna consider cost of ownership:gas, insurance, maintenance, repairs, tires, etc. To me, depreciation isn't a top factor. It's still worth considering, though, and each buyer and situation is different!. ",Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dx886cg,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8axmrm/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
151,Mikeymike304," I don't completely dissagree with you but there are some key things that need to be taken into consideration. First yes I agree there are different types of people buying cars. And it is a limited group buying these types of cars.. The super rich that just don't because it isn't worth their time and the rich people who don't care because the newest thing is worth the depreciation to them.. Next you have rich and well off people that can afford the car they want but SHOULD be taking into consideration depreciation. Depreciation is part of cost of ownership and on a car like an S class you can see 50% depreciation in 5 years. This means your 100k car which cost roughly 5k a year in maint, insurence, and gas will cost you twice that in depreciation. Now you mentioned having no intention to sell the vehicle. Even if you have no intention to sell the vehicle that is 50k additional you would have to pay in buying a new car than a several year old car that could even be under warranty still. At that point it becomes a personal cost benefit to you, is the slightly newer car worth paying an additional 50k?. The third type of person upperclass to well off person who may even be stretching their budget to get into these types of cars. I happen to have a lot of friends in this section and depreciation is the single most important factor they look at. IF anything was to happen to the car they can not eat a $50k depreciation and that includes both if they sell it or it is totaled in an accident or natural disaster. Some cars at this price point can even appreciate in value and that is what they try to find. Alternatively they look for cars that they know won't have a better replacement car come out in the next few years as that greatly affects depreciation. In this way they can keep cost of ownership down to about 10k or less a year.. That isn't to say that everybody does take depreciation into consideration but it does mean the people who are not may take a 50k+ hit to their bank account..

154,AlphaHacker," Hi guys,. I‚Äôm finally going to buy a car this summer, and was wondering if you guys could help with a few questions I had.. First of all, I‚Äôm 19 and living in Canada, and this will be my first car. I have a budget of about $4000-$4500CAD, and I‚Äôm lookin for something relible and preferably manual. I‚Äôll mostly use it to go to and from work (~15km) and for other daily driver uses. Looking at used cars listings in my area, I saw a few different models that caight my eye.. -Acura TSX. This car is one of my top choices, as it looks quite nice, it‚Äôs a bit more luxurious, and more fun to drive. There are not a ton of them for sale in my area, but I did see a 2006 one at $3950 with 190 000km. Would this be a wise choice, or should I just ditch the Acura dream and get something with less kilometers on it?. Hyundai Elantra. My second choice, the Elantra seems to be the car that has the lowest average mileage in this price range, along with the Civic. The most attractive offer I‚Äôve seen is a 2010 Elantra GL with 102 000km on it. I really like the looks of it, and my dad used to own the same model and I really liked driving it. The only think I‚Äôm not sure about is the reliabilty once again and how long it could last me. If this is not an issue, I may very well start to prefer it over the Acure actually.. -Honda Civic. For the Civic, I saw a few decent listings, the most attractive one being a 2008 manual 2-door Civic going for $4000 with 111 000km on it. I know that Hondas are super reliable, and this seems like a pretty good choice all around.. Toyota Corolla. Another well-rounded and reliable choice, the Corolla is also a good choice that I wouldn‚Äôt mind. However, the Corollas that I‚Äôve seen listed for $4000-$4500 are all over 170 000km. Is this a lot? I‚Äôm not entirely sure if it‚Äôs a good idea to buy a car with so many kilometers on it. Any insight you guys may have on this?. Mazda 3. The Mazdas I‚Äôve seen are all between 100 000km and 150 000km, and seem like pretty good deals. However, I‚Äôm not that familiar with Mazdas, so I‚Äôm not entirely sure if that mileage range is a lot or not. Once again, any insight/advice is appreciated.. Of course, the specific examples I‚Äôve given above are just that, examples, as I do not plan to buy for another 3-4 months, and those exact listings will probably be long gone by then. I simply included them to give you guys an idea of what is for sale around my area and what I‚Äôve looked at. By the time I‚Äôm ready to buy there will probably be other listings out there hopefully even better.. So, which one of those do you guys think will be the best choice for me? Also, are there any other models I should look at that could be found within my price range? Thank you all in advance!.

155,secretagentstv, The Acura doesn't sound to shabby. But at the same time it is high mileage and they tend to get pretty beat up. So if it looks like it has 190k km it probably isn't a good choice. Or if it has a long list of previous owners. Very reliable and fun to drive if well maintained.. I would say (anecdotally) that the Hyundai would be the least reliable on the list. I've known plenty of people that have owned all the cars on your list. I would say the people that had the most problems were hyundai owners. But still reliable. Not a bad choice.. The 110 km Civic sounds like the best option. But I think that may have been the Civic that was only one model year cuz it was hideous. Either way the seems to be the cheapest lowest mileage and the second most reliable on the list only behind the Toyota Corolla.. The Corolla is expensive relatively at least because a 30-year history of reliability and quality. Toyota is literally the safest bet when it comes to buying a car. Yes it's high mileage but if well maintained it will drive until the frame rust to pieces assuming you see some salt on those Canadian roads. Safe bet.. Mazda 3 great car pretty good-looking and I would say one step above the reliability of the Hyundai. But that may be my Japanese preferential bias. I know that Mazdas have a reputation in New York for being rust buckets (not current but previous generations). Not a bad first car should last a while.. Now keeping all that in mind. I would say. Civic for Best value. Corolla for Best reliability. Mazda3 for fun and looks. TSX best car on list but used TSXs are a crapshoot. Hyundai least reliable and boring. ,Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dx82c0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8axmrm/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

168,IKnowNewCars," If you generally lease, a Giulia is a fantastic idea. Reliability is the only issue with them, and if you don't own it, it's not you problem. Really a fantastic car. My ideal choice would be a Giulia Ti Sport w/ 19"" wheels, summer tires, and the Performance Package.. Other similarly priced sporty luxury options include the Audi S3, Audi A5 (and A5 Sportback), Kia Stinger GT, or to be honest, it's hard to beat the M240i. If you're interested in any of these, I can dive deeper into them or let you know how I would configure them.. On the sensible side, a totally decked-out Mazda 3 wouldn't be a bad idea, especially since its interior is so nice for the money and they offer a manual transmission in the top trim level. It might also be worth considering a Mazda 6 with the new turbocharged engine, though the manual is only offered on the base engine. The Honda Accord can be had in Sport trim with the 2.0T engine and a manual, and it's honestly a lot of fun to drive, but opting for the top level Touring trim with the 2.0T and auto transmission is a great mix of fun and comfort at a good price.. On the other hand, if you want something fun and don't need it to be particularly luxurious, there's plenty of American muscle available to you. A Mustang GT or Camaro SS could be configured with a manual transmission, great performance options, and decent interiors. Opting for magnetic suspensions on either model let you balance a smooth ride when you want it and a very capable suspension when you need it..

169,atxlos," Thanks for the reply!. I do agree that the M235 (and M240) are really tough the beat - i do love the car but cant really get myself to re-do a lease for practically the same car (m240). If i had gotten a few extras on the car (got it pretty raw) when I ordered my current car, I'd consider keeping it (even though I know that's financially bad).. I'm pretty surprised how much I liked the Giulia, even though its not manual, that car was pretty impressive - nice little spunky engine, luxurious interior. For some reason though, I keep thinking its cheaper than it actually is. I haven't quite considered the Audi S3 though it's not on the top of my list, and I used to own an Audi S5 V8 and thought it was a damn nice car.. I hadn't considered any American muscle, honestly, don't think its my thing. The Mazda 3 would be my sensible choice, it's a fun little car, my dad owns a new 2019 touring Mazda 3 and I'm impressed with it but doesn't 'excite' me like the others do.. What are your thoughts on the Audi A5/S3 as compared to BMW/Alfa?. ",Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dx73k6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8axmrm/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
170,IKnowNewCars," The S3 competes directly with the M240i, and it has a nicer interior and 4-door convenience, but the BMW beats it for a few reasons:it has a manual option, a great-sounding straight 6, it's quicker, and it just feels like a more pure driver's car. I still like the S3 a lot, but from a purely driving standpoint, it's hard to compete with the M240i.. Having said that:the Volkswagen Golf R has the same powertrain as the S3, . plus.  it has a manual option, for quite a bit less cash. And the interior is still fairly nice! If you want to save money, a Golf R would be a great way to go. Sadly, the 2018 models aren't at dealers yet, for reasons unbeknownst to me.. The A5 is similar to the S3 in terms of its one downside:its BMW competitors offer a more holistic experience for driving enthusiasts, partly due to being RWD. Still, the A5 is much quicker than the 430i and handles like a boss, Quattro AWD performs exceedingly well, and it's beautiful inside and out. I'd probably pick an A5 in Premium Plus trim w/ the S Line package, a manual transmission, and no-cost summer tires over a BMW 430i M Sport, but it's a close call.. The Alfa is in a different realm to me. The chassis, suspension, steering, brakes, engine, and transmission all come together to bring that Italian charm that can't be replicated in Germany or anywhere else. It's just so fun to drive. But if you test drive a BMW 3 or 4-series and an Audi A4 or A5 and don't feel like the Alfa has the edge, then it's probably smarter to stick with the Germans.. ",Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dx73k6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8axmrm/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
171,atxlos," I'll have to check out the A5 for comparison. It's been years since I test drove an A5, and that was back when I picked up the S5 instead. I know they're likely different at this point.. I'm still surprised how much I liked the Giulia, maybe it's my ego or my biased love for BMW/Audi, I couldn't wrap my head around how nice it was. Reliability is a concern, but I would def. lease it. I'm just so frustrated it doesn't come in Manual, and the paddle shifters on the wheel are obnoxiously large. Pet Peeves, but the car itself excelled over the BMW 3, and Audi A4 (and my friends C300) for overall fun, luxury and uniqueness.. My sensible side is tempted to just say screw it and go lease a Mazda for a few years and save up for some fun project cars or something, but who knows...decisions, decisions. The BMW was the first car I've ever leased, I've owned all my cars before, but the hassle of selling a car in a few years (in particular once the warranty expires) is just not appealing.. My car history: Nissan Sentra. Scion TC. Nissan Xterra. Audi S5. Honda S2000. Bmw M235. ??. ",Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dx73k6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8axmrm/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
172,IKnowNewCars," The thing about the A4 and A5 is that their 250 HP 2.0T engine is surprisingly quick off the line, more so than any of their direct competitors. A lot of that is due to Quattro AWD. If you're trying to stay under $50k, the current A5 is absolutely worth a look. If you can step up to the S5, 440i M Sport, AMG C43 Coupe, etc, that's a whole different ball game starting around $55k.. The Giulia is an enigma. It has its imperfections, but as a driving enthusiast, if I was in a place where I could buy a car like that and risk some reliability issues, it would absolutely be my choice, even without the manual (the paddles do make it hard to reach other things mounted on the steering column, but they look and feel really nice and work very well). But it's not for everyone and I totally get that. That decision is totally up to you.. Honestly, anyone planning on keeping a car for less than 5 years should be looking at leasing nowadays. Companies make it worth your while, especially luxury brands.. Ya know, if you're considering the Mazda but would rather have something more fun, why not lease a VW GTI? You'll save a lot of money over luxury brands, but you'll also have a great balance of fun and refinement. You can choose between the SE trim, which comes with some performance upgrades and lets you choose between the classic plaid cloth and nice leather seats, or go straight for the Autobahn trim to enjoy upgraded features like adaptive cruise and premium audio, as well as an adaptive suspension for more flexibility between a comfortable ride and capable handling. Plus they both come with manual transmissions. It could be a nice way to compromise between a more practical price point and getting the nicer interior and performance you're looking for!. ",Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dx73k6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8axmrm/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
173,atxlos," I honestly had never considered the VW GTI, that's a great recommendation. I'll have to check it out.. The Alfa appears to be leading right now - right in the middle of my price options (though I wish I could splurge for the Quadrifoglio!), but I'll go check out the A5 and VW. Chances are that I will lease any of these - I honestly don't plan on keeping them longer than a few years, maintenance on a BMW/Audi out of warranty these days is too much..

175,atxlos," so I havent had a chance to test drive the other cars yet, been traveling.. Though I've had a thought. I know that the general idea is that buying a lease at end is a bad investment, but I'm curious as to why. The residual on my 2015 M235 is $26.5k, and it seems, based on private party value, the car is valued between $25-$28k, mine being in fairly great condition - wouldn't that mean its not a bad deal?. I do love my car though it lacks some extra features I should have ordered with it - so now im considering keeping it an extra year or so and saving up for something more special (M2? Porsche?).

The base models for each are fine, but I think the second trim level for each model is worth the money:Honda Accord Sport, Mazda 6 Touring, and Toyota Camry SE.

205,prodigiouswaste," There's plenty of CPO German cars in your price range if you'd want to settle for something like an A3 or A4 over the S model (I would make sure to get the Quattro over a FWD model, if only to avoid the CVT transmission). At the top of your range you could squeeze into a CPO S3. Cadillac would also be a viable choice for something like the ATS. A BMW 320i or 328i would also fit the bill.. None of these are going to beat something like an Accord or Camry in terms of mpg or maintenance costs, just up to you if you think it's worth it. Unless you're really into cars, it probably isn't..

248,epilonious," Nope.  Trax/Encore is the CUV-ification of the GM Korea Sonic platoform... Equinox/Envision/Outlook is the CUV-ification of the Cruze... the Caddy XT5 and soon-to-be Acadia is the CUV-ificiation of the Malibu platform.  The Buick Enclave, Chevy Traverse and Older Acadias were CUV-ifications of the Impala platform, but they're gonna be replaced by Stretched Platform versions of the Malibu/XT5/Acadia platform.. Basically, Every Car Manufacturer realized Americans Love To Buy SUV's when things are good, and immediately switch back to hatchbacks and sedans and minivans when things are bad.  So instead of dragging mid-sized Body-On-Frame SUV's   into the 21st Century, they just started making hatchbacks and minivans that were jacked up and . looked.  like SUVs.. Thus, GM's layout I just laid down... then Toyota has the CH-R (Yaris), Rav-4 (Corolla), and Highlander (Camry/Avalon)... Honda has the HR-V (Fit), CR-V (Civic) and Pilot/Ridgeline (Accord/Odyssey)... Jeep has the Renegade (Fiat 500) and the Cherokee (Dart/200)... Nissan has the Juke (Versa), Rogue/Sport (Sentra), Murano (Altima) and Pathfinder (Maxima)... VW/Audi has the Tiguan/Q3 (Golf), Q5/Macan/Tuareg/Q7/Cayenne (A4/A6/A7/A8/Phideon)... Even RWD-focused car companies make mostly CUVs.  They just slap an ""X"" in front of it.   Mitsubishi is still cranking out stuff on the GS platform which they made with DaimlerChrysler.... Now, when the economy tanks and everyone has to go back to 'thrifty' cars... All the Auto Manufacturers can just reprogram the robots, spend a week retraining the workers, and put a call into the stamping plant for smaller body panels.  They'll just build sedans and hatchbacks and minivans on the same (mostly) FWD/AWD drivetrains powered by Fours and Sixes that they were before... they'll just be more efficient because they have less Cd and weigh less..

266,epilonious," No worries.  For short/tall, I'm going to say skip the minivan because they are now the longest chassis possible (The whole 'short minivan' thing died with the Caravan vs Grand Caravan).  Even the Mazda5 which was the last small minivan seemed longer than the CX5/CX7 CUVs based on the same chassis.. You want a CUV. and it's good timing because EVERY CAR COMPANY IN AMERICA is making them and wants to sell you one.  I'd lean towards CUV's that have ""Sport"" in the name (Nissan Rogue Sport, Hyundai Santa Fe Sport, Mitsubishi Outlander Sport) which is the auto-speak for for ""only 5-seats and short.""  Also, the auto-speak for ""Lengthened and given 7-seats"" is ""L"", so avoid the Rav4L and similarly named things.. There are going to be a bunch of the things... and even the teeny ones (Jeep Renegade, Nissan Juke, Toyota C-HR, Honda HR-V, Mitsubishi EclipseCross, Buick Encore, Chevy Trax, Ford Ecosport, Mazda CX3...) have tall rooflines.  The only downside about the teeny CUVs are a relatively recent development and some of them are Brand New so it's gonna be hard to find used ones that aren't CPO's coming off leases.  So basically, get on Autotrader and research all the CUVs out there and pick some of the ones with the feature/price points you want.. The usual caveats apply: The Toyota/Honda CUVs are going to be more expensive but will be more reliable, and the Korean/Domestic/Nissan ones are going to be cheaper but have some . issues.  that you may need to research (""Has the recall for rust been performed on this car because it's a 2013 and those had . issues.  in salt-road states..."", ""Is this one of the years that had the beefy/never-fail CVTs or one of the CVTs made out of tissue paper and roach droppings?"") but will probably garner better deals..

293,IKnowNewCars," I recommend skipping the Beetle for two reasons:First, Volkswagen reliability isn't top notch, so even with their new fancy warranty, you should expect it to be in the shop more often than your average car. Second, I have a hard time recommending the Beetle when the Volkswagen Golf is better than the Beetle in almost every way (except maybe looks) for about the same price. But when it comes down to it, the Beetle's not a bad car, so if it makes you truly happy, don't let me stop you!. I do want to clarify one thing you mentioned in your post: if it isn't technically sporty but looks that way, it's a bonus. By this do you mean that you want it to look sporty but you . don't.  want it to actually be sporty? Or would you like a sporty car but even a car that looks sporty (but isn't really sporty) is better than a car that looks boring?

294,thrsanne," Awesome, thank you so much for your advice on the Beetle. I don't know anyone personally who's ever had it so I never really heard anything about how it is beyond the looks. And if I can avoid being in the shop often, I'll definitely be looking towards my other options.. I do like Volkswagen (but still don't know too much about them), my friend has a GTI and it's a few years older than my car and still going, which I appreciate about it. I'll definitely consider the Golf!. For the sporty comment yeah, I think I meant a car that looks a bit sportier to me, is better than a car that looks boring. (And forgive me for this next part because I'm seriously terrible when it comes to knowing about cars.. lol) So even if a car isn't considered ""sporty"", but looks sleek and streamlined, kind of like some sporty cars, I think that's nice too.

295,IKnowNewCars," Thanks! I appreciate the clarification. So here are my recommendations: Honda Civic. Great all-around car in your price range. My favorite versions are the particularly fun stick shift ones (like the Civic Si coupe and sedan), but all of the versions and trims are solid choices for the money, so if the Coupe EX-L is the one you like best, test drive one!. Mazda 3. Mazda does a great job of injecting a sporty driving experience into all of their cars, and it's a bonus that they have some of the best interiors in their price range. My recommendation would be to test drive a Mazda 3 hatchback (5-door) in Touring trim with the Bose package, though the sedan is great too. The auto transmission is one of the better ones in its price range too!. Hyundai Elantra Sport. If you want something that looks sporty, feels pretty sporty, and offers a lot for the money, check out the Hyundai Elantra Sport. It's quicker than similarly-priced options from Honda and Mazda, while also offering heated leather seats and other nice features. Pricing starts just under $24k. If you prefer the hatchback body style, the Elantra GT Sport is similarly awesome.. Kia Soul! (Exclaim trim). It may not be what you had in mind, but if you like the look of it, you get a lot of car for the money by opting for the top-trim Soul. It actually has the same engine as the Hyundai Elantra Sport (Kia and Hyundai share lots of the same powertrains and platforms), but the body style is very practical and it gives off a lot of... well, soul!. If you'd like some more options, let me know what you like and don't like about these options, or simply test drive them and sleep on it!.

And the VW Golf's cost of repair would definitely be a bit higher than the cost of repairs for a Chevy, right?. THANKS! Super excited because I've never even bothered to look at Hyundai before, but I like what I've seen/heard so far!.

297,IKnowNewCars," There are a few different ways to look at repair costs. The first is to simply compare expected reliability for the different brands and/or models. These days, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, and Mazda are all higher than average when it comes to reliability ratings (according to Consumer Reports), though not as high as Toyota, which is consistently near the top of the list. Chevy is below average, as are most American brands. Volkswagen is below average too, but their new 6 year/72k mile bumper-to-bumper warranty helps alleviate that issue. Once they get out of warranty, VW and Chevy will both need repairs more frequently than the Japanese and Korean brands (on average), but Chevy's repairs are likely to be cheaper than VW's.. For another perspective, though, we can use Kelly Blue Book's 5 year cost-to-own comparison. It takes a bunch of factors into account:repairs, maintenance, insurance, depreciation, etc. Here's a 5 year cost-to-own comparison for 5 different cars: 2018 Honda Civic EX-L Coupe:$35,805. 2018 Hyundai Elantra Sport Sedan:$35,909. 2018 Chevrolet Cruze LT Hatchback:$37,007. 2018 Mazda 3 Touring Hatchback:$37,769. 2018 Volkswagen Golf SE:$39,074. The numbers look big, but remember that depreciation is the biggest contributing factor, which may or may not matter to you (if you plan to keep the car until it dies, it's less of an issue). Here's the comparison of . just.  repairs and maintenance over 5 years: 2018 Hyundai Elantra Sport Sedan:$2875. 2018 Honda Civic EX-L Coupe:$3596. 2018 Volkswagen Golf SE:$3815. 2018 Chevrolet Cruze LT Hatchback:$4210. 2018 Mazda 3 Touring Hatchback:$4304. The Golf's maintenance costs were actually the highest, but repairs costs were low because it would be under warranty for the entirety of its first 6 years/72k miles. On the other hand, Mazda's repair estimates were higher than I expected, given their good reputation for reliability.. I'm glad I could be of help so far!.

308,Slimy_Shart_Socket," So here's the thing, I'm not buying it any time soon, but I'm saving up. I love my Mustang, but there are some downsides. The handling isn't all that great, and I don't like how little torque there is low down. After 3500-4000 rpm it just flies, and doesn't feel it wants to stop pulling.. I'm saving up for my Next Muscle car and can't decide what to buy. I'm reading reviews on car and driver and they all seem pretty damn equal. I mostly care about straight line speed but I would like to be able to put the power down.. I'm reading reviews on the 3 from Car and Driver. 16' Camaro SS. 18' Mustang GT. 17 Challenger Scat Pack. and I can't choose. I'm looking at all the acceleration numbers and they are all fairly similar. The Camaro has the aded benefit or being the best handling, the lightest, and best chasis.. The Mustang however I work at Ford so I get employee pricing, but I want the performance pack so it'll cost the same as the Camaro. Also the Mustang seems to pull much harder after 130mph, being a full 2 seconds faster than the Camaro.. The Challenger has the biggest engine, the most horsepower, and the most torque. I see these things running 11s with a handful of bolt ons.. I really want something that will push me back into my seat hard..

312,IKnowNewCars," If that's the case, I'd definitely go for the Mustang GT Performance Pack. You'll have a very capable vehicle that's more comfortable as a daily driver than the Camaro.. For reference, I am a Mustang fan, but I always try to be unbiased. Even though the Camaro offers the best performance on average, that performance advantage doesn't outweigh the Mustang's nicer interior until you hit the 1LE, which maximizes the Camaro's already fantastic chassis and suspension. I haven't gotten a hold of a Mustang GT with the new Level 2 Performance Pack, but when I do that will be a fantastic comparison too..

351,IKnowNewCars," Are you interested in having fun driving around corners and down twisty canyon roads? BRZ.. Are you more interested in comfortable cruising and/or just going fast in a straight line from time to time? Mustang.. For an automatic transmission, in general I'd say the Mustang is the way to go. Consider adding the Pony Package for a truly classic look. (. Edit:  I should also mention, if a fast 0-60 time is a priority, opt for the Performance Package instead of the Pony Package, and you'll be able to hit 0-60 in 4.9 seconds with the EcoBoost engine and 10-speed auto transmission.

378,IKnowNewCars," Deciding between a sedan and a crossover/SUV will probably be down to your dad's personal preference. If he doesn't need the extra cargo space and other practical advantages of a crossover, a sedan would certainly be my recommendation. The one exception is about seating position:some older folks prefer a vehicle where the height of the driver's seat lines up better with their hips, as it's easier to get in and out of.. Let's start with sedans: The C300 is always a solid choice, particularly for its gorgeous exterior, high-quality interior, and comfortable ride quality.. The Audi A4 Quattro does a very nice job of balancing luxury with a sportier driving experience, so I'd check one out in Premium Plus trim. Even if you dad doesn't need a sports sedan, having a powertrain that offers easily-accessible power is helpful for easy highway driving, or even putzing around town.. An off-beat choice that's definitely worth looking at is the Kia Stinger, which offers a lot of interior space and features at a price that undercuts the Germans by a lot (though it's not quite as refined overall). If your dad doesn't need to go fast, the Premium trim decked out with the Drive Wise package would be $40k and offer everything he's looking for. On the other hand, the GT1 trim is only $44k and includes an incredible engine and suspension upgrade, and the GT2 trim tops out at $50k with everything and then some.. If you're interested in even more interior space but keeping the luxury badge, price tags mostly start around $50k and go up quickly (think Audi A6, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, etc). The best deal that's close to your dad's price range is the new Genesis G80 Sport, which at $56k offers a fantastic 3.3T engine and chassis, a very nice interior with a crazy amount of cabin space, lots of great standard features, and thousands of dollars of savings vs similar buys from the German brands.. If you're OK with ditching the luxury badge, your options open up a ton. A Honda Accord Touring 2.0T would top out under $37k, offer more interior space than a C300, and include a ton of nice features and interior appointments. For even more space and an even nicer interior, a Nissan Maxima Platinum would run $42k with an impressively comfortable interior, smooth ride quality, and very nice materials.. As far as crossovers go, the GLC is a solid choice. My favorite in its class is the fairly expensive Porsche Macan. A great middle ground, though, is the Audi Q5, which does a great job of balancing comfort and luxury with a nimble driving experience (especially for its size). Any trim level on the Q5 is worth the price, but the best deal is the top-level Prestige trim, which offers so much for the money. Add the Warm Weather package (a Godsend if you live in SoCal), and you end up at $53k.. Have you dad test drive some of these and just see which he likes best!.

380,IKnowNewCars," Lexus has had its ups and downs lately, in my opinion. Their mid-size options like the ES and GS just aren't great for the money compared to others on the market. You can get a lot from the IS350 F Sport, which is meant to compete with the 3-series and C-class. It's not exactly fast, but the chassis and suspension are both well done, balancing nimble handling with smooth ride quality. The sport seats that come on the F Sport version are . so.  comfortable too. And of course, there's its legendary Lexus reliability. The IS350 F Sport starts at $46k, but even if you deck it out with packages and options, you can't go that far past $50k.. On the crossover side, the RX350 is the most popular option, and while I find it a bit too relaxed (ie, boring) for me personally, a lot of folks love its smooth ride quality and comfortable interior. It starts around $44k, but again, the F Sport model has the best blend of added features and improvements to driving dynamics, starting around $50k.. My personal favorite of Lexus's crossover right now is the NX300, since it provides very similar comfort and interior quality as the RX at a lower price tag, as long as it's big enough for whoever's driving. Yet again, the F Sport model is definitely my recommendation (comfortable sport seats), but the price tag for the NX300 F Sport is only $39k. Even adding the Premium package keeps the MSRP to $42k.. Have your dad test drive any of them he sounds interested in. Again, the difference between the sedans and crossovers will mostly be in the ride height and seating position..

393,xVsw," How many reasons do you want? Start with the basics.. Reliability issues, requires premium fuel, maintenance is expensive and frequent, list can go on for a while. This is a product that is premium in name and badge only and this is objective and not just a preference or opinion. Objectively compare anything about that vehicle to a rival from Japan or Korea.  Infiniti isn't the best choice either. Nissan still hasn't fully rebounded from the GFC. Lexus is the solid if you want something like that but lets be real, Toyota gets by on steady mediocrity which is why people say it's ""boring."" Still, steady mediocrity puts them ahead of all but a handful of players right now.  Something tells me Lexus holds too much value and is too desirable in the second hand market to fall in your budget. There's a reason why used Mercs are so cheap.. That said, I get it. It's not always about logical decisions. Out of the choices you listed, I'd pick the Honda. But then again, I'm not even clear what model years or much less what years we're talking about here.  Honda took a big shit after the GFC as well. Up until the brand new 2018 models, Honda were still using engines fundimentally developed in the 1990's.. meanwhile competitors like Subaru, Mazda and the Koreans have had advanced, modern, direct injection, turbo engines, on offer for a while now..

395,xVsw," The Koreans, ie Hyundai and by extension KIA, have also blown up since then. Past few years they are making some of the best new cars dollar for dollar that you can buy.. Whatever you pick, I would keep a few things in mind. Consider the age of the technology underlying the car. Lots of new cars are actually ""old"" cars dressed in new clothes if you catch my drift. Consider premium vs regular petrol. If a car requires premium, you really must use it or you will have problems.. otherwise it's a waste of money. Consider the warranty, if applicable. Consider the service interval. 1 year is what it should be for a modern car. 6 month interval should be a turn off.. Check the TSBs - technical service bulletins, for any car model you consider buying..

398,xVsw," If you had to pick between these, it's the Honda without question. But to be honest I would consider other options like Mazda, Kia or Hyundai. The Infiniti is a non-starter to me for various reasons. Get a Lexus if that's what you want. But  I suspect the resale value on the Lexus puts it out of your price range.. There's a reason for that. Honda is just now starting to recover from the global financial crisis now in 2018. 2015 was still within what I would consider to be their dark ages. Those cars have known issues with paint, transmission and in general are just OLD.. ie the technology, engines, etc, are old. Honda was amazing in the past decade, but after 2008 they fell off the cliff in terms of R and D. A 2015 Mazda, Kia or Hyundai would objectively be a better choice in every measurable way. For example you would get a much better engine, ie more modern, direct injection, etc..  transmission, safety, economics.. But also even things like 1 year service intervals and generally better warranty, if that's relevant to you..

399,xVsw," Old tech.. engine, chassis, etc.. Must use premium fuel. Requires service every 6 months. Lots of power, but not the best fuel economy. watch out for off-lease lots. Safety is pretty bad and lacking compared other options.. Check the TSBs, for both cars. I looked real quick for the Infinti, but there's just too much for me to commit right now.. Based on the info you provided, and the choices you provided, I would pick the Honda without question. However I believe you could objectively do better looking at Mazda, KIA or Hyundai models from the same model years. Plus the Koreans would still be under warranty, unlike you other options.. ",Sub_Content, 4 months ago,t1_dtqrvf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7trmi6/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
400,xVsw," You know. Neither are ""bad"" cars, I was just of the opinion that you could perhaps do better if judgement was placed on objective criteria rather than sort of sentimentality of appeal and attachments.. To put in simple and blunt terms Infinti is not at all like Lexus to Toyota. Some might scoff at that as some of brand preference wankery, but it's based in facts. Nissan is another brand which dipped into a valley after the GFC. Compared to some other options, the underlying product is just ""old."" The engine, great engine, sure. But you do realize, like the Honda as well, the engine was developed in the mid 1990s? I believe the 2013 model did get updated with variable valve timing ie like Honda's VTEC, which is great and all but hasn't been cutting edge since the early 90's, but I don't think you get direct injection like a modern engine would have. Also you have a 6 month service interval and you have to use premium fuel. The price does add up. A more modern alternative will have direct injection, possibly a turbo, only needs service once per year, and runs on regular not premium.. while delivering probably slightly less performance - because lets be frank that Nissan engine you're looking at is somewhat of a performance engine - but better economy. Another issue is the safety on that car leaves much to be desired. Again this goes back to the whole GFC and the slump for Nissan. Honda tool.. Have you checked the TSBs on either vehicle? Do that.. If you're planning on buying the vehicle from an off-lease lot, those places are known for selling bondo jobs. Some of them don't even really try to hide it. Check the vehicle history report for an accident. If it's a vehicle which came off the lease and is being sold used by the same dealer, this makes sense. But it's probably too old for that, right? My point distills down to this, when you said ""off-lease"" my red flags go up. Check the history report, and have someone you trust physically inspect the vehicle for any signs of collision repair..

442,Nitro987," How much do Volkswagen Passat's go for where you are? A 1999 B5 Passat with a fair amount of kilometers (~250tkm) and overall great condition go for about a grand here in Finland. Stock speakers are decent, very comfortable to drive. Fuel economy isn't too good compared to smaller cars (I got about 12l/100tkm in city driving, on the road it was about 6.5l/100tkm.) Engines are known to last those lucky few up to 600tkm on those gas Passat's, so don't be afraid to look at ones in the low 300tkm's..

462,IKnowNewCars," I'm gonna disagree with the other dude on this one. Sure, the Yaris iA isn't the fastest or the coolest. But it's one of the best buys in the new car world for under $20k. Tons of standard features including active safety, a surprisingly comfortable interior, and a surprisingly enjoyable and fun driving experience (despite being low on power). Keep in mind that the back seat and trunk are both rather small, but if it meets your practicality needs, I think it's a solid bet. I'd much rather drive an iA than a Corolla, which has a driving experience very much devoid of pleasure (in my opinion).. The newly redesigned Hyundai Accent is a solid little car, but the best deal on one is the base model with a manual transmission. If you're interested in an automatic, check out its corporate cousin, the Kia Rio 5-door. The S trim gets you a decent amount of standard features, a comfy interior, a fairly refined driving experience, and a practical hatchback body style for only $17k MSRP. If you want even more interior space and seats that fold down into the floor, the Honda Fit has your name on it (the Sport trim with CVT comes out to $19k and looks pretty slick too).. Going with the bigger sizes, like the Civic, Corolla, and Mazda 3, there are lots of great options, but you'll probably have to get a base model to fit in your $19k budget. Feel free to test drive a few and see if any of them fit the bill. One exception to the rule might be the Chevrolet Cruze, since Chevy is offering lots of incentives and discounts on their cars compared to the Asian brands. A Cruze Hatchback in LT trim w/ an Automatic transmission, plus the RS Package (because it looks awesome) comes out to about $23k MSRP, but getting that down to $19k should be very doable. It'll be more roomy than any of the subcompacts from before (Accent, Rio, Fit, Yaris iA), but not as fun to drive as some of its competitors (Civic, Mazda 3, etc)..

A family member is in desperate need of a new car and has no money so we are considering giving them the civic and getting ourselves a new car and are looking for some suggestions. I am leaning towards getting a late model, low mileage used car to save money but would consider something new if there is a compelling reason to do so.. Will be driven in a major city but parked in a parking garage both at home and at work. The city is full of shitty roads and shitty drivers so we will probably get something less nice than we can otherwise afford because we don't feel like ruining a nice, expensive car.. the wife has an important job that keeps her very busy so reliability is very important. getting repairs is a major inconvenience and is expensive where we live. we are not able or willing to do any maintenance ourselves. we have no garage or tools. she likes the size and handling of the civic but at this point in our lives we can do a bit better. we would like something a bit more ""luxurious"" but not much, if any, bigger than the civic. comfort is more important than performance since this is mostly to be driven in the city.. we would like some modern amenities that we are missing out on driving a 12 year old car. things like back up camera, blind spot warnings, auto braking, etc. dont care about satellite radio or navigation since the phone does those things better anyways. the idea of an electric vehicle is appealing to her and we have plugs available both at home and at work. this isn't a must but its something to consider. maybe a plug in hybrid of some type? that way she would never have to get gas during her short commute and we could still take longer drives when needed. we both like the tesla model 3 but are not willing to pay to be beta testers so that is out. maybe in 3 or 4 years I'd get one.. price range is about $20 - $40k. I realize that's a big range. We can afford more but don't feel like spending extra money that we don't have to. We are not looking for a status symbol, just a nice car, and like i said above, we don't want to feel too bad if/when it gets fucked up by some idiot driver or giant pothole. we rarely have passengers but I think since this is our only car its probably a good idea to have 4 doors. no need for a bunch of cargo room though.. thanks for your suggestions.

Toyota‚Äôs hold value really well, so their used cars aren‚Äôt the best bang for your buck. Their interior design has always been super conservative and behind the times like Subaru‚Äôs.

It does come with some nice tech as standard like radar cruise control. Adding advanced entertainment options really make the price skyrocket though.. The Toyota RAV 4 also has adaptive cruise as standard and is available as a hybrid. The hybrid gets great city mpg.. The Honda CR-V is less expensive and also has apple car play.. I would also suggest the Mazda CX-5 for a lease in that range. A few inches longer than the X1 but similar in footprint to the Prius Prime. They can be very well equipped for a reasonable price including a pretty decent stereo and even stuff like a heads up display.. The X1 is nice to drive, but adding tech or entertainment options makes it get really expensive. Might end up costing too much once you add the features you want..

536,pm-me-ur-car-pic," I think the Subaru WRX limited would work for you. Has heated seats, AWD, and a manual. They can put down awesome times at Auto X with some aggressive coil-overs and tires on them but for a daily driver I would just keep it stock. The regular WRX gets okay fuel economy but does take premium gas.. The Scion FRS/Subaru BRZ/Toyota 86 are an obvious choice. I think only the BRZ was available with heated seats though.. Another option is a Mustang Ecoboost Premium. Get pretty decent fuel economy and the Premium model has heated (and cooled) seats. A little harder to find with a manual but they're not super uncommon. You can also put a factory-aproved Ford Performance tune on it for a little more power. Takes regular gas but does supposedly make more power on premium.. The Chevy Camaro V6 is also an option. I think they call it the RS. It's a little hard too see out of which can make daily driving a little annoying but they're pretty fun to drive. Some should have heated seats.. You could also look at an NC Miata. The 2006-2015 Miata has more space than any other generation and is still awesome to drive. Grand Touring models had heated seats and you'll probably want to find one with a LSD too (handling package I think). Not going to be as roomy as a WRX or Mustang, obviously..

I was thinking about FRS/86/BRZ they've been on the list, but I'd rather the AWD. With the Mustang and Camaro they're good cars, but if I was going to get a Muscle Car I'd want the V8.

If you're going to sell the car and get a new one after a few years, then leasing makes sense. Both should have incentives for new graduates. You might get a worse leasing/financing deal due to having little credit history though, so watch out for bad deals..

Desired transmission (auto/manual, etc):Either. Intended use:Weekend and Track. Vehicles you've already considered:AMG GTS, 981 GT4, 911.1 GTS, Considered stretching for a 911.1 GT3. Is this your 1st vehicle:No. Do you need a Warranty:No. Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:Yes. Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:No. Additional Notes: I've been tracking my C63 more often and now I have the track bug. This thing isn't a track car in the slightest and will go through tires like crazy so I'm looking for a weekend car that will be tracked once a month. AMG GTS ticks all the boxes but when I drove one it felt way too big, like I was driving a barge. It's almost  as heavy as my car and that bothers me, but it's got an appeal like none other, not to mention they're getting cheap (85k).. The GT4 is the other contender I've looked at and I haven't ever driven a manual on a track so I'm kinda nervous I'd fuck something up. Price is very similar to the GTS and might even drop more once the 718 GT4 gets released.. The 911.1 GTS felt very similar in terms of straight line performance to my car, it was fast but not blistering, throw your head back into the seat, fast. Obviously it was a corner king though which outshines my car any day of the week. These are going for around 100k right now, so I'm real curious how it compares to a GT4 on the track. PDK is also a bonus. Also, I've noticed some 911.1 Turbos have dropped to a very similar price.. The 911.1 GT3 is the car I want but when I compare it to the AMG GTS, I don't see it being worth 40k more. Performance is similar, and I felt more confident when I drove it since it's obviously lighter than the GTS. But 40k more? It's a steep price.. My other option I suppose is to get a Cayman S and mod the hell out of it, but I'm not to thrilled about a 4 banger. I guess my real question is to AMG GTS owners or people who've driven it on a track -- is the weight something that is just a learning curve or do you have to manage it constantly? How often do you need to switch tires?. ",Main_Content, 13 days ago,t1_e0fw03w,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8ogg6z/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

But that first problem has since been resolved (I wanna say post-2013, but don't quote me), and the second problem has also been resolved (post-2012) and doesn't seem that big to me, imo, at least in terms of costs relative to the vehicle class..

612,IKnowNewCars," One thing I'll mention straight out of the gate:in my opinion, the best versions of each of these cars have MSRPs that hit just over $30k: Subaru WRX Premium w/ Performance Package:$32k. Honda Accord Sport 2.0T:$31k. Mazda MX-5 Miata Club:$30k. You may just want to go test drive all of them and see what sort of deals you can get on each from their respective dealerships. I'll tell you right now:if the Miata meets your practicality needs (2 seats, soft top, small trunk, very little interior storage), it could be the most fun way to spend $30k on a new car, period. It's just so good. The WRX is certainly more practical, quicker, and AWD, but it's not all that daily driver friendly, with a fairly harsh suspension and noticeable turbo lag. The Accord will be the most practical and spacious, and with the 2.0T engine and manual transmission it's actually got some sport prowess with solid handling and power. But I wouldn't call it a sports car.. The S2000 ceased production 9 years ago, and with their semi-cult status, I have no idea what the used market looks like for them right now. But I do know people have an absolute blast with them, with its main draw being a naturally-aspirated straight-4 engine w/ VTEC that revs to 8000+ RPM. If you're interested in going this route, I'd ask around for folks with S2000 experience first. You may also want to check out the Subaru BRZ, another lightweight Japanese sports car that happens to be a bit more practical than a Miata, and is available new. A BRZ Limited w/ Performance Package is available new for just over $30k MSRP and would be another incredibly fun option..

614,IKnowNewCars," If I was choosing between automatic versions of those two, it would be the Accord, easily. Going fast is nice, but if I'm not gonna be able to shift for myself, I'd rather also have the car be spacious and comfortable. Comparing the manual options I mentioned before, though, that's a much harder choice. I'd need to drive the WRX again to see how I would feel about it as a daily driver vs the Accord Sport 2.0T manual. They'd both be a lot of fun in their own ways..

621,parker2535," 20k is low for a new car. Not recommended, cars lose a ton of money the second they go off the lot. Id go for something maybe a year old with all the maintenance records. It will take a little more searching but you'll get a much bigger value for your money. Suggestion would be a Toyota Tacoma. These trucks last forever. My father had a 97 tacoma base model and it still had plenty of power to get through anything. Never left him stranded and they hold their value very very well! His tacoma had well over 250k miles I want to say near 300k if not more, not sure due to the gage broke about 5 years before it got totaled by some idiot who didn't know how to drive in the snow. Fun fact though after it was totaled he still drove it for a while before the insurance company officially took it so it technically never died. You owned a GMC but trust me its time to check out the imports if you want a real bulletproof off road vehicle. MSRP starts at 25k for a brand new tacoma but if you get one a year or two old you'll be in your price range and have a good looking bulletproof truck that would be good for off-road or commuting..

635,IKnowNewCars," In its class, the Civic is a favorite, offering a well-rounded compact that does just about everything well. Out of its three body styles, the hatchback is my personal favorite:spacious, practical, and a bit more nimble feeling than the sedan, plus it comes standard with the 1.5L turbocharged engine. Whichever body style you pick, fuel economy is near the top of its class.. The Corolla carries the torch for best reliability in its class (with the Civic and others close behind), but it loses out on nearly everything else:it's boring as sin to drive, its interior is cramped, etc. Toyota is redesigning the Corolla iM hatchback for 2019, and while it won't be a night and day difference, it looks like it'll see some improvements over the current one.. Other compact options include the Mazda 3, a favorite for folks wanting a bit of sporty fun in their value-priced compact. The Hyundai Elantra, Elantra GT, and Subaru Impreza all have their ups and downs as well, but are on the reliable side. The Volkswagen Golf might be the most refined compact in its price range, with the newly redesigned 2019 Jetta being improved over its previous generation and worth a look as well, though neither has a reputation for long-term reliability.. Lastly, if your price range leaves you open to only the base models of these cars, feel free to check out some smaller subcompact choices. If you can sacrifice interior space, you might get more features for the money. The Toyota Yaris iA sedan is a favorite, as is the Honda Fit. The Kia Rio was redesigned this year, and the hatchback model in S trim is a great deal for under $18k MSRP. Its corporate cousin, the Hyundai Accent, was also redesigned and is well-built for the money, if you'd rather go the sedan route..

Go to Honda's web site and build your own Type R, and you'll see besides choosing the color, you have no choices.

668,IKnowNewCars," When your friends say that FWD isn't good, in a very general sense, they have a point. RWD is considered by most enthusiasts to be the most fun, since they're usually less prone to understeer around turns, and often you get controlled oversteer (sliding, drifting, etc) that doesn't happen in a FWD in quite the same way. But the Type R is a whole different story:Honda has made one of the best-handling FWD cars in history, and with its awesome blend of quick acceleration, a nimble chassis, a great transmission, and surprising levels of daily-driver comfort, the Civic Type R is honestly one of my favorite hot hatches on the market today. You'll have to drive it yourself to see how you like it, but when your friends give you crap for considering a FWD car, remind them that the Type R beat the Focus RS, Golf R, and STI (all AWD performance compacts) on the Nurburgring.. The STI has the most robust AWD system in its class, since it's symmetrical instead of being front biased. If you actually intend on driving fast on dirt roads, sand dunes, etc, there's no replacement for a WRX or STI. Having said that, it's probably the worst deal in its class to buy new. Its powertrain and other tech are falling behind, and it's simply not as quick and capable in terms of track performance. It's not a bad car, but going used or CPO on an STI might be a better plan than buying one new.. One thing to keep in mind here is that these performance compacts are great if you need 4 doors and (except for the STI) a hatch. But if you can get by with only 2 doors, a smaller trunk, or maybe even only 2 seats, it's really worth considering some other options. I don't know enough about the used BMW market to tell you which ones to recommend, so the M235i may be a solid bet, but if you can find a BMW 230i M Sport with a manual transmission for under $40k at a dealership (or order one), you can get into a new BMW sport coupe in your budget range and still have a very well-done car.. There's also American options to consider, like the Mustang and Camaro, always locked in a battle for pony car supremacy. You can look at this one a few different ways:a Mustang GT w/ Performance Pack Level 1 would run you $40k MSRP (or $42k with the upgraded Sync 3 infotainment system, which I highly recommend). 0-60 in 4.3 seconds, awesome handling for its size, and an engine that sounds as great as it feels. Active exhaust costs $900 to add. Whatever MSRP you end up at, you should be able to buy it for thousands less at the dealership. If you want to save more money, an EcoBoost Premium w/ Performance Package would be only $34k before discounts and manufacturer incentives, and believe me, the newly-updated 2018 EcoBoost is nothing to scoff at, hitting 0-60 in just over 5 seconds thanks to a peak rating of 350 lb-ft of torque. If you'd rather go the Camaro route, the ultimate track car for the price is the Camaro V6 1LE, which starts around $35k and is shockingly quick around a track, thanks to a fantastic chassis and suspension upgrades that bring the best out of it.. And then there are smaller sports cars, like the Miata Club, 124 Spider Abarth, Subaru BRZ, etc, all of which offer about as much fun as you can get for their price range. Your first step is probably to think about what your practicality needs for this car, then test drive some of them that will meet those needs in your price range..

693,eskamobob1," Late 80s vs Early 90s Toyota truck questions: Basically I am debating between a late 80s toyota truck (~84-98) or an early 90s one (89.5-95) (or maybe even a gen1 4runner) and I'm trying to find out more information about the two to decide, but problem is, I have a lot of questions. Is there a place better than here to ask all of them?. Here are the questions if any of you can answer anyways though: Just for some background. I will 100% be getting a manual (largely just because I like them, though i head the auto trans in these trucks sucked anyways), I plan to get an xtra cab either way, a bed north of 6', and very likely 4x4.. The first questions are on engines. 22RE is said to be sluggish, but my question is just how sluggish. I drive a 74' beetle with like 35 HP, and I dont care if the car super zippy, but I absolutely want higher cruising speeds and a . bit.  more power than that since it will be my dd. Thoughts on the 22RET? I cant find much info on it at all. As for the 6-cy 3L (forget the designation), people tend to just shit on it all the time online, but of the 4 people I know that have owned yota trucks of that era, they all said that the v6 realy did have quite a bit more power when they test drove both at dealerships. I wont be towing, but will load it down with lots of stuff when I camp, so what you your thoughts on it? How much more am I looking in general maintenance over the 22RE? I can do most general maintenance myself (and everything outside of the engine and electrical is 100% in my skill set).. The second set is on safety of sorts. I know safety regulations were largely rewritten in the 80s, but the redesign happened at the beginning of the 90s. Are the early 90s trucks much safer than the late 80s ones? Honestly, I think this will play a much lesser role in my decision (I do drive the airbagless tin can that is called a beetle currently after all), but I would like to know.. The last is of practicality. People that have owned a late 80s xtra cab, does it actually give you much more room at all? I realize that that 90s have fold down seats, which is part of my consideration, but most commonly it will just be a place for me to put my gym bag and backpack so I dont have to go get them out of the bed all the time. Also, Does the late 80s seat 3 on the front seat? I had a buddy with an 82 that did, but his car was so sketchy he may have just put in the extra lap belt himself..

694,benicebitch," The relative rarity of these trucks means you really probably won't have as much choice as you like. Many that you will drive will be modified, often by taking the best of different model years or aftermarket solutions to some of the problems you're mentioning. Go drive what's on sale and buy the one you like.  If there's only a couple of things you don't like about it, do some googling on possible solutions. Somebody has figured out how to fix most anything you don't like.  If you find one you're really in to, look around on the forums for common issues with it before you buy..

695,eskamobob1," Because I don‚Äôt mind waiting a couple months and tolling CL in a variety of areas, I‚Äôm actualy not having a super hard time finding specific models surprisingly enough. The early 90s are easier to find, but it‚Äôs far from impossible to find the specific models of 80s that are largely stock (looking at xtra cab only actualy helps finding lesser modified ones too). I think kind of my biggest worry is the lack of power of the 22RE. I don‚Äôt mind low power, but I do want more power than the bug I currently drive, and I‚Äôm just having trouble figuring out if people just mean less than modern cars, or comparable to the bug.. As for forums, which ones do you recommend? A large portion of why I‚Äôm asking here is because a lot of the forums I find were last updated in like 2007.

I don't own a current toyota truck so I don't know what forums are active but you don't have to google much to find the best one.. Power is pretty subjective unless you're doing serious towing or rock crawling. Sounds like that's not you. You really just need to drive trucks and see what you like. Your car is so slow that nothing is going to feel slower, so you probably won't mind the 4 banger..

698,IKnowNewCars," I haven't driven the 2018 Accord Hybrid, but I love the 2018 Accord overall, so I figure the hybrid is worth test driving. The base model has a solid number of features, including active safety, but if you can afford the EX trim you'll add on heated front seats, power driver's seat, nicer infotainment screen, power moonroof, blind spot monitoring, etc.. You should definitely test drive a few hybrids to see if it's what you want, though. The driving experience isn't quite as nice as a traditional gas engine, usually. And the biggest MPG gains are in stop-and-go city driving, rather than highway cruising. If you can pull off buying an electric or plug-in hybrid (both of which almost require an at-home charger), it could be a great choice, but your budget does limit your options in those realms, and it depends on how far you need it to go on a single charge.. In the long run, if you decide you'd rather go with a gas engine, I'd try out the new 2018 Toyota Camry. The redesigned model is nicer to drive than the old one, and you still get all the space and reliability. The SE and XSE models are both a bit sportier and more fun than the LE and XLE models, and any of them with the base 2.5L engine will get best-in-class fuel economy..

Vehicles you've already considered:Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5, Subaru Forester, Volkswagon Tiguan. Is this your 1st vehicle:Yes, but it'll be bought under my parents. Do you need a Warranty:Probably yes. Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:I don't mind buying a car service manual and learning to do minor work. Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:Nope. Additional Notes:Mainly used for daily commute driving. Will be moving to a region that snows regularly during the winter and will be driving in off hours so I don't expect roads to be plowed during those times. The AWD is more for peace of mind for my parents, depending on my driving experience on snow and ice, I'll probably invest in getting snow tires too.. I've been eyeing the Subaru Forester because of their AWD system, but I'm not sure what years to avoid when looking at used options because I read about some head gasket issues in older models..

709,IKnowNewCars," If you're looking under $25k and lower is better, you'll probably want to go lightly used or CPO on a crossover in the size class you're looking at. Most of them still start above $25k new for AWD models. Other folks will give better advice on used options than I will, but I can say that the CR-V and CX-5 are always favorites, and the Forester has been solid recently. The Toyota Rav4 is probably the most reliable option, and may appeal to your barebones side, though it's not exactly exciting to drive.. If you do go with the Forester, 2013+ 2.5i models will all have the FB25 engine, which has been solid so far, no gasket issues of note. CVT reliability has been iffy, but Subaru extended the warranty on their Forester CVTs to 10 years/100k miles on many of those models, so double check that with the owner before purchasing..

710,Uanaka," Thanks so much for the reply, I looked at CPO options but I saw CPO options of like 2015-2016 Subaru Foresters were already about $20k in my area, so I thought I might as well consider new since it wouldn't be considerably more expensive.. I completely forgot about the Rav4, but i've heard it's trailing behind other brands in terms of technology. Even though I don't mind the barebones, it's nice to at least have some more technology options even in the base models.. I've read some issues on CVT reliability, but from what I've read, it only seems to be Nissan that has early CVT failures and other options are still fine..

717,mjsbullitt, I have a 16 WRX and I've been debating trading it in for a MK7 GTI.  Granted I have a long highway commute with two really crappy pothole cities as the end points and the WRX is just too rough at this point.  The GTI is a bit of jeckl and hyde where it's very composed and nice riding but when you want to have fun it has a different personality. And this was with the DSG.

745,IKnowNewCars," What is the best medium sized luxury CUV on the market?. The Macan. My opinion, of course, but once you test drive one you'll see why. It's honestly amazing next to some of the boring crossovers in its class. By comparison, the X3 is engaging but not as much as the Macan, the Q5 is a nice package but feels isolated with muted steering, and the RX is spacious and comfortable but mostly devoid of driving dynamics (try saying that 5 times fast).. Here's Car &amp; Driver on the Macan's back seat: Passengers in the back seat will have almost two inches less legroom than in the next smallest competitor, and anyone over about five feet 10 inches tall will notice the difference. The small back seat also limits space for rear-facing child seats, so the Macan is probably best for drivers who don‚Äôt often need space for four or five.. And on the cargo space: A puny cargo hold and small interior cubbies make the Macan one of the least practical vehicles in this group. But when has buying a Porsche ever been a rational choice?. I can't speak to the X3's cargo volume, except to say it seemed pretty sizable by my memory. The Q5 has one of the bigger cargo volume ratings in its class, but real-world tests with carry-on suitcases showed that it couldn't carry much more than the Macan, while the RX350 beat it handily, carrying the most in its class with the rear seats folded flat. Having said that, the Q5's back seat folds 40/20/40, which gives it more flexibility than most.. I think it's gonna come down to test driving all 4 of them with your wife, balancing the driving experience, features, and interior space with your budget range to find what will work best for you. They're all fine crossovers, but after driving the Macan, I wouldn't want to drive any of its competitors if I could help it..

On that same note, I feel $32+ is a bit much for a Camaro.  Any thoughts on cars to get?  I don't need a super track-only car, which is also why the C6z isn't my pick, since I won't be tracking it nearly as often as DDing it.  I feel a C6z would be so much power that I'd almost never use.  C7 is on the map too, but with a fully-loaded Camaro being $10k less than the absolute base C7, I have a hard time justifying it..

763,martianshort," In your price range, I found enough z3‚Äôs to make it worth a look. Maintenance is expensive compared to a Miata. The last year of the z3 is 2001 so the youngest car is 19 years old. If you can find a single owner car that has been maintained at a dealer with lots of paperwork and list of replaces parts, then you might get something much cooler than a Miata.. It‚Äôs a 6 cylinder in this little car. Interior is very nice, but electronic buttons have higher chance of failure compared to Miata. Not enough to scare you off though.. If you have 10 to spend, buy a z3 for 7k and keep the 3k for possible repairs over the next 2 years of ownership. If money is tight get the Miata, if you can take the risk of 20 year old German ownership, you may come out on top since nice z3‚Äôs are in your price range.. http:/atcm.co/S2PVDP/1cfbefc1. http:/atcm.co/S2PVDP/1c912027. http:/atcm.co/S2PVDP/1ce2d6fb.

You have NO idea what you are going to want to do with your time and money when you finish school, but I betcha taking out that chick from tinder is going to be a LOT more fun than tearing down an engine.   I promise what's under her hood makes better noises than what's under yours.. Modding any of these cars can get really expensive and you can break even more expensive stuff if you fuck it up, which you will. The BMW might set you back 12k, but the parts are just as expensive as they were when it was 50k new.. If you really want to mod something, but something cheap when you graduate as a 2nd ride. Either it will sit in your garage for 6 months and you'll sell it at a $500 loss, or you'll mod the shit out of it and have a blast, but either way you won't have to take an uber to work if you screw the pooch and can't get it put back together by Monday morning..

I put a CAI, Vanguard dual catback exhaust, with a Stage 2 COBB tune and that kitty purred. Next on my list was going to be a Mishimoto intercooler and potentially downpipes/BOV. The exhausts and CAI alone made my car sound amazing, but I have a friend who added the downpipes/blow off valves to his and it sounded even meatier..

I've spoken a bit with the owner and was told that they bought the car as a salvage and got the rebuilt title themselves. They said the damage was done on one of the front headlights and the bumper from a hit and run in a parking lot, and they had both replaced and checked for frame damage.. With that being said is something like that enough to cause a salvage title to begin with? Is the car still worth looking into? What price do you think is fair for it if so (Asking is $5300).

836,Transmaniacon89," Check out the Elantra GT Sport, and GTI SE.  Both come with a manual and offer up a nice alternative to the Mazda3.

837,IKnowNewCars," If you like everything about the Mazda 3 hatch but think it would be a tight fit, the first step is to test drive one next to its competitors. The Mazda 3 hatch in Grand Touring trim w/ a manual transmission is a pretty awesome daily driver in many ways (with a really nice interior for the price). But next to it, there's the VW Golf SE, which is a bit more spacious in the rear and also great to drive. The Civic Sport hatch is awesome with a manual, but a sunroof isn't an option in that configuration. I'm also a fan of the Chevy Cruze hatch, but the manual transmission really isn't great.. On the sportier side, the Elantra GT Sport is well-priced and nice on features, but like the Civic hatch, the sunroof is only available with the automatic transmission. The GTI SE is the sweet spot among sport compacts if you can afford it, offering the best of all worlds in a sense (MSRP is $31k but VW has been giving decent dealer discounts in recent years). Additionally, it may be worth it to check out the Ford Focus ST. The interior isn't the nicest, but it's an absolute blast to drive, and since Ford is discontinuing it soon with the rest of their non-crossover 4-door cars, you can get even bigger discounts than usual. A Focus ST with Equpment Group 401A (moonroof, Recaro seats, Sync 3 infotainment, etc) has an MSRP of $30k, but you might be able to get into one for $25k, potentially less.. FWD with winter tires should be enough for most snowy weather, but if you decide AWD is a big plus, the Crosstrek is a good way to go. It has a few minor benefits over the Impreza, though they're almost the same in every way, but there's one important difference:the Crosstrek got the new 6-speed manual for 2018, which is MUCH better than the old 5-speed unit the Impreza still uses. If you want something more fun to drive that still has AWD capability, the new Hyundai Kona has a secret weapon:an optional 175 HP turbo-4 engine that makes it very quick for a little crossover.

I'm a college student in Michigan, and I currently drive a 1994 Buick Roadmaster Limited. Despite being a total grandpamobile, I like the Roadmaster since it's been pretty reliable, comfortable, and kinda fun with the torquey small-block Chevy, but it gets pretty bad mileage (about 18-20 combined) and it's starting to show its age (133k miles, and being a 90s GM vehicle, all the electrics are starting to go).. I have a steady engineering job and commute about 500 miles a week to work and college. Looking for something that gets better mileage but is still practical for hauling things like camping gear or kayaking (hobbies of mine). Fun to drive would be a nice plus but not a necessity.. My dad is a GM employee, so it might be a little tough to sell the family on a foreign vehicle. I'm open to ideas though, I have no real brand loyalty either way..

I've been considering a car with a lower overall cost of ownership since I don't see maintenance getting any cheaper, and it's becoming harder to justify a sporty car that I really only get to open up on the freeway.

",Main_Content, 19 days ago,t1_e0445tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8ogg6z/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
850,IKnowNewCars," The feel of the Civic Si isn't quite like the GTI, but the performance is surprisingly close. It isn't as quick in a straight line, but it handles better at the limits. It also has a lot of desirable standard features (dual-zone automatic climate control, heated seats, moonroof, nice sound system, etc), plus comfortable seats with a decent amount of side bolstering, all of which come together to make it a balanced daily driver. It's not as fancy or refined as the GTI, nor as practical, since it doesn't come in hatch form. And it doesn't have an auto transmission option. But for a reliable, fun car, it could be a fantastic choice. You'll have to test drive it yourself. (Make sure you opt for summer performance tires, an absolute steal as a $200 upgrade!). A Mazda 3 in Grand Touring trim makes a fun, comfortable daily driver, even with an automatic transmission, but it's hard to say it replicates the feel of a GTI. Same goes with the Hyundai Elantra Sport and Elantra GT Sport. In the end, a GTI is a GTI. There's a reason people are willing to put up with VW's less-than-ideal long-term reliability woes. It was awesome in 2010 and is still awesome now.. Having said all that:if a Miata RF meets your needs and budget, it's hard to think of a reason not to consider it, even with an automatic transmission. Test drive it and see what you think..

The Miata RF always seemed like an impractical choice given the size, but I'll definitely test it out; I've always wanted to anyway.. You're right about the GTI; it's my fourth car and nothing I've driven really compares.  Maybe the Si or Miata can get me close.  Thanks again for taking the time to answer..

Looked at the Honda Pilot but don't care for the infotainment system.  VW Atlas felt oddly cheap on some of the materials and mechanical touches like the seats.  Local Subaru dealer is getting a demo Ascent this weekend, but I don't really know anything about Subaru reliability and their typical total cost of ownership with things like repairs.  The 7 passenger with captains row/bucket seats configuration intrigues us.   Honestly they third row will probably be down 90% of the time we own it, but we have a growing kid and are always over stuffing the Escape.  Also, we don't care for Mazdas or Nissans.. Currently down to the Pilot and Atlas, but unsure.  I think we might be able to get a fully loaded Ascent or a step down trim with technology added for cheaper than a fully loaded Pilot.  Also haven't had a chance to see an Ascent but have seen plenty of videos recently that all say it is a decent ride.. Open to suggestions but that is where we are at.  Thanks!.

892,IKnowNewCars," Lots to touch on here: Kia has become one of the most reliable brands for sale in America, with Consumer Reports ranking them 3rd in their most recent study, right behind Toyota and Lexus. The Sorento may not seem all that big, but its interior space rivals similarly priced mid-size SUVs, a 3rd row is standard on the upper trims, and the interior is surprisingly nice. The SX and SX Limited trims might be worth a test drive, and to boot the Sorento's getting a refresh for 2019 that looks good as well. It's not my favorite mid-size crossover, and it's not exactly exciting, but it provides a lot for the money.. The Pilot is another that's not my favorite, but is a good responsible buy overall. It's basically a minivan surrogate, providing a lot of space and comfort without the sliding doors and dorky look. Honda reliability has been above average overall, but average among Japanese and Korean brands.. The Atlas is great in a lot of ways, especially with its spacious 3rd row and nice driving experience, though interior materials are a bit disappointing. VW reliability is better than it used to be, but still below average, while their newly upgraded 6 year/72k mile bumper-to-bumper warranty mitigates that somewhat. I like the Atlas a lot overall, but if you don't need the spacious 3rd row and want something more stylish and reliable over the long term, it may not be ideal.. Subaru has been an interesting case for reliability. They've been rated better than most brands lately for reliability (at the same level as Honda, or sometimes better), yet they have had issues with CVTs needing repairs and replacements a bit more often than would be ideal. Having said that, the Ascent looks great and will probably be one of my favorite three-row SUVs if it's as nice to drive for its size as early reviews have indicated. I think it's worth a shot when you get the chance to try it out.. The Highlander is gonna be your most reliable option, but it's also one of the most average and boring in other ways. It's safe, flexible, and smooth to drive, but it's not all that pleasant feeling to accelerate and steer, and even with its easy-to-use interior, the third row is on the small end.. If I were you, I'd test drive all 3 of the ones you said you're considering, plus the Kia Sorento SX. All of them should do the trick, it's just about which one fits your wants and need the best..

916,JesusSama," So, there's a few trims depending on the year. For '16, for example, there's the S, SE and Autobahn Trims. For '17, they added the Sport Trim along with those three. This year, they went back to S/SE/Autobahn.. You can most likely find a '18 discounted to get it well below $25k but only on the S Trim.. For the '16 or '17 GTI, though, you'll hit a variety of pricing ranges depending on what's the most important thing for you along with optional packages (lighting package for example).. Here's a sight breaking down the '17 Trims.  for example that and what the real difference is.. Most people covet any GTI with the lighting package, so if you go for one used, that's a really nice feature to have.

But once you find one you like, you can get it for thousands off MSRP, even brand new. The fun-per-dollar ratio is crazy good.. Wait, I just noticed you put Auto as your transmission choice.

I know it'll almost certainly cost me a lot of money, and I'm not doing anything until I have a bunch saved up, but I bought this car because my parents didn't approve of me buying any of the fun cars I really lusted at during college, and I really feel like I'm starting to resent my decision now. I want to drive an ""enthusiast's car"" while I'm young and mostly unattached, because I may move from Texas to Canada or some other, colder place in a few years, so I want to get good at RWD before I move somewhere way fucking colder than the place I've lived my whole life. I know this is stupid, but life is too short to drive boring cars, and you have to pay to play, so sometime this year (probably about 6 months from now) I want to trade into some kind of economy performance car, preferably RWD, for absolutely no more than $22,000, and I'll lie to my parents about how much money I spent. I really think I want a stripper EcoBoost mustang with performance package... And maybe mag ride üòÇ.

971,Bhtruong," Wow thanks so much for the response! I agree with what you said about the Mazda. You get a ton of tech from it and I love the styling, not to mention I've been hearing good things about the turbo engine. Never really thought about the Civoc Type R or the Stinger but I think those will have to go into my list of cars I need to test drive(hehe). The Golf R is a damn good car but it just looks a bit too grown up for me.. I also think I have an itch in me that wants to stand out a little, and that's why I'd like to try and stay away from a the typical sedans like the Accord/Civic or Camry/Corolla. I see a ton of Mustangs and Camaros but they get a pass from me probably because of their sportiness and how they're usually customized in some way.. Thanks again for your advice, I won't be buying my next car in awhile but I do want to begin test driving when I can..

976,IKnowNewCars," If you fit people or stuff in the back frequently, you'll be happy you went with the GTI. I love Mustangs to death, I'm quite the fanboy, but my next car can't be a Mustang for a similar reason. It doesn't meet my practicality needs.. Now if you're on the edge, maybe unsure about whether you really need 4 doors or a hatchback, I would test drive a properly spec'd Mustang and see if it really blows the doors off the GTI for you. For most people in the $35k range, I'd recommend an optioned EcoBoost over a base GT for a more well-rounded daily driver that still has performance chops. Start with the EcoBoost Premium, add the Performance Package, tack on the MagneRide suspension if you can, and pick whichever transmission appeals to you. MSRP will be a bit higher than a GTI SE, but you'll probably get a bigger discount on the Mustang than you would on the GTI anyway.. Test drive both, and see if the Mustang's fun and performance outweighs the GTI's practicality and refinement. That's gonna be tough, though, because the GTI is very fun to drive as well, though not as quick as the EcoBoost in a straight line..

980,IKnowNewCars," The symmetrical AWD system in a Subaru will be able to tackle nearly any dirt or gravel road, along with most rough weather situations (given proper tires). A more rugged off-road-ready 4WD system will be able to drive quickly over rough roads or sand without losing its composure, climb over small obstacles, deal with mud and excess water, etc. An Outback can handle some of these things, but a Tacoma 4x4 might be able to do it quicker and with more confidence. Of course, forest service roads leading to back-country campsites are often given a . little.  bit of maintenance, so I can't imagine you'd come across one where you felt an Outback wasn't rugged enough to handle it.. The other issue is that trucks, indeed, have shot up in price recently. Buying a brand new truck with decent options means starting around $35k and going up from there. And Tacomas just seem to never die, so their depreciation is among the slowest on the market.. The Outback isn't perfect, but considering its price point, fuel economy, interior space, safety ratings, reliability, and symmetrical AWD system, I don't know if any other option meets your needs quite as well. If possible, I definitely recommend buying one with EyeSight so you can take advantage of great active safety and driver assistance features (like adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist)..

As another outdoorsy-ish person looking to own a car for the first time, I know that AWD is great for these situations, but do you have any experience with what happens on those same dirt/gravel roads . without.  AWD? I'm looking at the Impreza hatchback vs. Civic hatchback, and the Civic has points in its favor but the lack of AWD seems like a dealbreaker..

982,IKnowNewCars," In most situations, FWD vs AWD is the different between more wheel slippage and less wheel slippage. It honestly depends on the road in question and your needs. Most dirt and gravel roads will be fine in any FWD car that has decent ground clearance, as long as you're OK with going kinda slow. For reference, I drove a couple fairly long, rather bumpy dirt roads in my Mustang while on a road trip last summer, and despite being RWD with only about 3.5 inches of ground clearance (lower than stock), I just went slow and it made it.. If you spend a lot of time on dirt and gravel roads, it just depends on whether it's worth being able to go quicker and more comfortably over them in an AWD car. FWD won't be dangerous, just a bit more annoying at times. I know if I was in your shoes, I'd still pick the Civic over the Impreza, but then again, I don't have to deal with winter weather or other AWD necessities..

984,IKnowNewCars," The difference between all-season tires and winter tires is WAY bigger than the difference between FWD and AWD when it comes to winter weather. If you put snow tires on a FWD car, you may still have to work a bit to become unstuck from snow, or you may have to be gentler on the throttle when starting from a stop, but you won't be slipping and sliding around on the highway. If you have the means of buying winter tires (and cheap wheels for them) and storing them until you need them, by all means do it..

The big things I'm into with the GS are the super adjustable seats, adjustable suspension, quality of materials, and general reliability. I assume the Gensis has the same dope warranty as most other Hyundai's so I'd feel comfortable with the reliability from that, but the GS with the Preferred Accessory package gets the adjustable bolsters, the leg part of the seat can move on it's own, along with the typical back/forth/up/down controls.

992,IKnowNewCars," Deciding between a 2-door and 4-door car can be a conundrum if you can't see the future. But it's important to remember that there are plenty of 4-door cars out there that are very fun and sporty. You don't have to sentence yourself to boredom. (By the way, I'll be focusing on new car options here, because that's what I do.). First of all, it may not be a bad idea to consider the many performance compacts in the $35k-40k range. One of them could be just the balance of performance and practicality that you're looking for. My favorite overall this year is the Honda Civic Type R, which looks a bit aggressive, but I think it strikes the best balance between comfortable daily driving and a truly joyous driving experience. It's just a blast. It's hard to find one at a decent price, but you can probably find one for MSRP these days, which will keep it in your budget range. My next favorite is the VW Golf R, which is refined, composed, very quick, and more grown-up looking than the Honda. VW's reliability has been suspect lately, but for 2018 they increased their warranty coverage to 6 year, 72k miles, bumper-to-bumper, which makes up for it in my eyes. Both of those are great options.. On the other hand, if you want something with 4 doors that's freaking quick and nice as a daily driver, the Kia Stinger GT might be the ticket. It starts right around $40k, but you can get it for cheaper, and its performance is definitely worth it:0-60 in 4.4 seconds, a very well-built chassis, and a suspension to match. Plus the interior is very spacious for the money, and even if it's not as refined as its German competitors, it's just such a crazy value proposition for costing less than $40k.. Of course, if you wanna spend less money and get more features, there are mid-size options that can do the trick. The new turbocharged engine in Mazda 6 looks awesome, but I don't have personal experience with it yet, so I can only assume how great it's gonna be. On the other hand, I do know how awesome the 2018 Honda Accord is, so opting for the EX-L or Touring trim with the 2.0L engine definitely gets a recommendation for me if you want to balance value and practicality with a fairly sporty driving experience. It's no Mustang, but it's a good time, and the back seat is very spacious.. If you do decide that you don't need 4 doors, it's hard to beat the value you get out of a Mustang or Camaro. The rough part is that for $40k, you can't get all the best options to really get the most out of a Mustang GT or Camaro SS. But you can get a big engine, which in the long run will never disappoint. But in your price range, if I was picking a pony car, I'd pick the Camaro 2LT w/ the RS package. Sure, the 335 HP V6 isn't as punchy as the 455 HP V8. But it's no slouch, by any means. The RS package gives the car a great look, as well as some bigger wheels and tires to help the car retain its grip in tough corners, taking advantage of the very well-done chassis. With the 2LT package's leather seats (and opting for the auto transmission), you end up at $36k MSRP before incentives and dealer discounts, and I honestly think it's very worth the money..

1005,_Hnnng_," I've been driving a 2012 Honda Accord for the last 6 years and have had it paid off for 2 years now and am finally making a little over 70k with a promotion coming up in a month or two that should put me around 85k.. I've always loved cars and can finally afford to get a nicer one, so that's what I'd like to do.. I do not like hatch and would want something that is aesthetically pleasing to look at on the outside and would want a sports car as well. I would be more willing to sacrifice some performance for a better looking car. And I want a sedan.. I know I could get a Ford, Chevy, Nissan car with over 300 horse power but those cars are so common and plain looking to me.. I'm still not 100% on exactly what I want, but looking to pay between 40k-60k and most likely a CPO. I've test drove Audi's and BMW's and like the 5-series but still want to test drive an M3. I also have been looking into some Mercedes.. What would you all recommend looking into in that price range?.

1008,IKnowNewCars," The difference between a Silverado and an A3 is massive. In general, I recommend getting the smallest vehicle that meets your practicality needs, since that's how you'll get the most fun, luxury, features, and fuel economy for your budget. The exception would be if having a more spacious interior is an important aspect for your daily driving comfort, but again, that's personal preference.. So let's get down to the nitty gritty: What are your practicality needs? Would you use the truck bed to haul things you couldn't fit in the other vehicles? How often? Do you need towing capability? Is AWD preferred? Would an increased ride height help you in rough weather? Do you need any off-road ability? How often will you be driving other people? Will you be fitting adults in the back seat regularly, or kids? Will a trunk be spacious enough for cargo, or would a liftgate be better? Would it be helpful to fold down the back seats to store more cargo from time to time? And lastly (since you mentioned tall friendly), what's the smallest vehicle you'd still consider tall friendly? Is your Cruze tall enough, for example?. That sort of info will help us narrow down whether you need full-size truck, a small sedan, or something in between..

1009,Tech_geek23," I'm currently single with no kids in the immediate future. My Cruze fits me fine, I do miss the higher seating position of SUVs and trucks or any size. However for a more sporty car I'll take the lower car for performance.. Commuting to work it's just me and when I do have passengers it's 1 maybe 2 at most. I have put 2 in the back before.. I'm thinking it might be helpful to have a bigger load area for transporting goods. I barely got a 49"" TV, sound bar and subwoofer kit, and TV/console stand all fit in the car last weekend.. AWD/4WD would be nice but not a must. North Carolina so far seems rainy rather than anything. Not sure how their snow tends to be.. Towing is not in the picture at the moment and using the truck would have been nice buying furniture. But it's not often. I fold my Cruze seats when needed but can't fit tall objects (couldn't fit TV on top or the stand's box like I was hoping).. I have always liked taller ride heights but also like sportier cars. But right now I need just one vehicle. ",Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dxoj3ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8cmqxg/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
1010,IKnowNewCars," If you decide having a truck bed is important, the Colorado is a solid choice. It's certainly rugged, and you can get a lot for your money. But my recommendation on that front would actually be the Honda Ridgeline. They did a great job of combining solid mid-size pickup capability with a comfortable cabin, ride quality more like a car than a truck, and some really nice convenience features (like a dual-action tailgate, locking in-bed trunk, etc). The RTL trim is a solid balance of features and value, coming in just under $38k for AWD. The upper trims have ""fancier"" infotainment, but Honda's 8-inch screen is frustrating to use, so stick with the 5-inch one and save your money.. If you decide you don't need the bed and want something that balances sporty and practical with a crossover-like ride height, a small luxury crossover like the Audi Q3 is a great idea. Having said that, the Q3 is far from my favorite. Its competitors offer more for the money: The Mercedes-Benz GLA250 is one of the sportiest of the bunch, basically a luxury hot hatch marketed as a crossover. If you pick your options well, you can keep it affordable and still get what you want:Start with 4MATIC AWD, opt for the AMG Line exterior/sport package, then add Smartphone Integration (and maybe heated front seats too). MSRP stays under $40k before dealer discounts and you've a fun, well-rounded daily driver on your hands.. The Volvo XC40 will be a new addition to the segment for 2019 and should be hitting dealerships sometime this summer. It's not as fancy as the more expensive models, but the R-Design trim comes with a sporty suspension that pairs well with the T5 engine and standard AWD. You don't need options to have a well-equipped model for under $39k, but heated seats and a couple other things might be nice additions.. On a different note, if you're OK with losing the luxury badge and going with something less conventional, I highly recommend test driving the Volkswagen Golf Alltrack. It's a wagon version of the VW Golf that's been given the crossover treatment (increased ride height, plastic body cladding, standard AWD). It's still rather fun to drive, like a VW Golf, but it also has the cargo capacity and seating position you're looking for. All of its trim levels are well equipped, even the $28k base S trim (leatherette seats, heated front seats, nice infotainment and Android Auto are all standard). So it's up to you to decide how much you're willing to spend for fancier features!.

1012,IKnowNewCars," The GLA has 8 inches of ground clearance (compare to the 8.7 inches of a Subaru Forester or Outback, for example). Total height is 60 inches, compared to 62 inches for the Audi Q3. The back seat is fairly small, but the front seats are decently sized and I'd imagine it would feel a bit more spacious than the Cruze.. The fancier Mercedes-AMG GLA45 is the hotter version and it's lowered for better handling (only 5 inches of ground clearance, probably lower than your Cruze). But it starts over $50k. The GLA250 is still very nimble, and 0-60 in 5.8 seconds is nothing to scoff at..

1053,IKnowNewCars," A Miata will often be more reliable than your average car. They're fairly straightforward, to be honest. Their minimalist approach is part of what makes them so much fun. If buying a Miata meets your practicality needs (as in, if you can handle having two seats, a small trunk, and very little interior storage space), absolutely go for it. If you go new, opt for a manual transmission in Club trim.. ",Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dxmh78x,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8cmqxg/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
1054,harimaurimba, Thats so good to know! I've been mildly convinced that most Mazdas are simple enough cars but still fun to drive. My previous 2009 Mazda 2 was the sturdiest and most maintenance-less car I've ever driven. I love that car to bits! I was looking into the newer Mazda 2 the other day (the Fit is very spacey but rough on the road) but couldn't get my eyes off of the Miata!. I know this sounds very daunting but is there a reason I should opt for the manual? Is there a quirk to the automatic? I can drive manual but I'm not too fond of it.. ,Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dxmh78x,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8cmqxg/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
1055,baconandtheguacamole," Automatic Miata is almost an oxymoron, but go with what you like best because it‚Äôs your car and yours only. The Miata is basically a throwback to a past era of small, lightweight British sportscars like old MGs and Triumphs. These cars had low horsepower and weren‚Äôt fast in a straight line, but they handled very nimbly and put a smile on your face with their open air experience and fun, charming character. These old cars always only came in manual because up until recently in automotive history, automatics kind of sucked the fun out of driving with sometimes lathargic response to change speeds, and a less direct feel. With a manual, you are more one with the car because you have a certain sense of control over what the engine and drivetrain are doing. It‚Äôs more of a direct connection between man and machine, which is pretty much what the whole point of a car like a Miata is in the first place. So opting for the automatic dilutes that a bit. Is an automatic Miata a bad car? Absolutely not. Will more hardcore car enthusiasts maybe turn their nose up at an automatic Miata? Yes they will. But again, choose what you will be happiest with, because other people won‚Äôt be driving it anyway so who cares what they think. Personally I would never buy an automatic Miata (and I almost bought a first gen Miata a couple years ago, so I get why you like the car) but I also really enjoy driving manual. If you don‚Äôt enjoy it then don‚Äôt force yourself into it just because it‚Äôs the so called ‚Äúproper‚Äù choice though.. ",Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dxmh78x,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8cmqxg/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
1056,harimaurimba, Fair points. Manual transmission has always been kinda alluring to me but I haven't driven one in the past 3 years. I'm just not confident enough to drive it around town in traffic (though I usually use the highway). It doesn't help that none of my family members whom I still live with don't have and haven't driven manuals. So practicing isn't so practical without a manual car available. I may end up opting for the manual though since this is supposedly my fun car (I'm still keeping my auto Fit for work commutes).. ,Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dxmh78x,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8cmqxg/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
1057,baconandtheguacamole," As far as driving around town and everything, it really becomes second nature after awhile. Do be aware though that clutches general last year's but do eventually need replacement as the friction material is basically the same a a brake pad and it does wear over time. It wears less if you are good at driving stick, but you will likely be hard on the clutch initially. And it is expensive to have replaced by a shop and a crappy job to have to perform in a driveway because you need to remove the transmission from the bellhousing (which is the part that matches the transmission to the engine). So just be aware that a clutch is another possible maintenance cost but that being said it would only have to be done once over the lifetime of the car more than likely..

1059,harimaurimba, Another question. What model year is the minimum for me to look for a used Miata? I understand older models in good enough condition and decent mileage will do. But how far behind can I go just before it feels like driving a different car than the modern ones (3rd gen upwards). Perhaps maintenance and reliability-wise they could be a bit different.. ,Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dxmh78x,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8cmqxg/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
1060,lampredotto, A good way to think about it is: NA (1989-1997) feels like a 1980's car. NB (1999-2005) feels like a 1990's car. NC (2006-2015) feels like a 2000's car.. Seems obvious but it's a good way to generalize.   NA's and NB's are lighter and more nimble-feeling than NC's.  An NB might be a good fit for you-- there are still some low-mileage examples out there and you can pick one up for next to nothing.. ,Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dxmh78x,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8cmqxg/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

1094,baconandtheguacamole," Can I ask why 6 seconds is such a big deal? I say that because there are fast cars that are so isolated that they don‚Äôt even feel that fast, and there are slow cars that are so visceral that they actually feel quick anyway. It‚Äôs really not about chasing a statistic because unless you‚Äôre racing the car in competition then the numbers don‚Äôt matter much.

1096,baconandtheguacamole," There‚Äôs a saying:‚ÄúCheap, fast, reliable. Pick two‚Äù. First of all, do not get an S60R. The shocks cost about a grand each to have replaced because they are electronically adjustable between three settings. That car can easily become a money pit. Miata is a good handling car but impractical (tiny, shallow trunk) so be aware of that if it‚Äôs going to be your only car. Also you‚Äôd be looking at first generation cars at that price which at this point are quite old and rust prone. And also they are much slower than 0 to 60 under 7 seconds, but that‚Äôs not really the point of the car anyway. Regarding a Civic Si, a 2001 to 2005 Civic Si could be a really good choice. These are known as the ‚ÄúEP3‚Äù Civic as that is the Honda chassis code for them. They are less desirable than other generations of Civic Si because they have a suspension configuration that is technically not as good as the older cars, but they are still good cars nonetheless. Good interior design, nice seats, enough power to have fun with (I can‚Äôt remember the 0-60 time but it‚Äôs around 7 seconds) while still getting decent fuel mileage on regular gas and also the hatchback shape gives you some added storage space for a small car. An Acura RSX is basically the same car under the sheet metal, but is a coupe with a lift-back design instead of a hatchback. So RSX is a solid choice too. As always, condition is important when used car shopping and with these cars getting older now don‚Äôt be afraid to take your time to find the right one as long as you have a running car you can drive now in the meantime. Whatever you do, don‚Äôt buy the first thing you see just out of impatience. Luckily with EP3 Civics because enthusiasts didn‚Äôt flock to them like other Si‚Äôs you have a higher chance of finding one in stock condition. I highly recommend not buying any car that has been (likely poorly) modified by the previous owner. Buy something stock in decent shape, not something with crappy eBay parts all over that somebody thought would be ‚Äúcool‚Äù. I know this was kinda rambling but hopefully it provides a little bit of direction..

Evo is out of your budget. 350Zs and G35s are getting pretty old at this point. If you can sacrifice some power have you considered a Subaru BRZ or Scion FRS?

1110,_Hnnng_," So, I'm tired of posting/reading on . /r/personalfinance.  about getting a new car and if it costs more than $10,000 then they say its absurd and I'll never be able to afford the maintenance, blah blah.. I've been driving a 2012 Honda Accord for the last 6 years and have had it paid off for 2 years now and am finally making a little over 70k with a promotion coming up in a month or two that should put me around 85k.. I've always loved cars and can finally afford to get a nicer one, so that's what I'd like to do.. So with that said, I'm hoping to get a better response here. I'm still not 100% on exactly what I want, but looking to pay between 40k-60k and most likely a CPO. I've test drove Audi's and BMW's and like the 5-series but still want to test drive an M3. I also have been looking into some Mercedes.. What would you all recommend looking into in that price range?. Depending on how good of a deal I could find, I'd most likely put down 20k (unless I'm lucky to find 1% or under interest rate) and finance the rest for 5-7 years.. Also, anything else I should be considering before making this purchase? I know my insurance will be higher as well as some maintenance costs..

With your price range, there's really a LOT that you can go for especially if you're open to any brand of car.. For example: A crossover luxury car with some oomph to it would be a Porsche Macan.

Hell, you can even go with the new Kia Stinger.  that's really turning heads, is very well priced and can REALLY go.. If you want a hatch, go with the Golf R.  as that'll be the perfect blend of luxury, top of the line specs and tech while being sporty as fuck and a fun drive.

Last car was a Camaro, I had the first one in my entire city, and within a few weeks of it arriving I had a supercharger and a camshaft in it. Currently daily driving a 9 second c6 with a tank of methanol in the trunk. I'm not practical.. I'm getting a bit tired of the c6 though as I swear its a lemon or something. Everything is breaking and nothing that is breaking has to do with the power or mods. Its just falling apart. I'm getting ready to have to replace the differential (which is because of the power, actually) and I'm just about done with it. I'm going to keep it and probably eventually turn it into a strict race-only vehicle, but I wont be driving it on the street anymore.. I want something interesting, fun, and can be modded to a useful degree. Sure you can put a turbo on a miata, but I'm not spending $4000 to get 200rwhp, for example. I want a platform that is actually worth the time. I dont want a mustang or a challenger because I've already had the Camaro and I feel its basically the same thing. I've tossed around the idea of a VERY used Gallardo and then putting turbos on it in the future, but I feel like the dollar:un ratio just isnt there, hence why I'm having a hard time with this. The C63 can be modded to a 9s car for about $8000, which is great, but it isnt a very exciting car. Same thing with the GTR. I drove a stock GTR and a 800hp GTR back to back and couldnt even tell the difference between the two because it is such a boring vehicle.

1133,IKnowNewCars," Always needing a car that's &gt;5 years old is tough. If you buy new every time, you'll suffer a decent depreciation hit, and even if you get a car that's likely to hold its value better than average, you'll have to go through the process of selling it and buying a new one every 5 years. If you go for a 1-2 yr old car, you'll lose less in terms of depreciation, but you'll have to go through the process every 3-4 years. I think your best bet is leasing, to be honest! Check out . Car &amp; Driver. , who puts out a list of cheap lease deals every month. The May one isn't out yet, but the one I linked to is for April and should still be mostly valid.. If we're looking for a new car w/ AWD in the $20k range, your best bet is probably a small crossover. There aren't many that have manual transmissions, but the one I definitely recommend checking out would be the Subaru Crosstrek. It was redesigned in 2018, and even though it's very similar to the 2017 Impreza (except with an increased ride height and plastic body cladding), it got a new 6-speed manual transmission that's very good. The Premium trim is only $800 more expensive than the base trim and is definitely worth it, the MSRP coming out to $23,500 before dealer discounts. It's not exactly a sports car, but the manual makes it more fun than most in its class.. The most fun in its class is probably the Mazda CX-3. The Mazda 3 hatchback is a bit more spacious and less expensive on average, but AWD isn't an option, and the CX-3 approximates its sporty driving character pretty well. The Touring trim is worth the upgrade over the base Sport trim, but it does bring the MSRP to $24k (with AWD) rather than $22k for the Sport. No manual option, but it's still very fun and sporty to drive.. If you want a manual option that's fairly unique and rugged for its price point, the Jeep Renegade is worth checking out as well. Its manual transmission comes with a 1.4L turbo-4 engine, sourced from Italy due to Jeep sharing the same corporate overlords as Fiat.  It's a very good time. The Latitude 4x4 trim comes out to $25k MSRP, but you may also want to add packages like Cold Weather, Safety &amp; Security, etc. Jeep has offered big discounts on their vehicles lately, so you'll pay way under sticker price if you're a decent negotiator..

He is wheelchair bound, so if we want to go anywhere the chair has to come with.

1196,IKnowNewCars," Since your car suggestions are all over the place and you're not positive on the budget, I figure that's a good place to start. Being recently out of college and having a nice job, it can be hard to figure out where to draw the line between a nice car and a fiscally responsible car. Trust me, I know the feeling.. Start with two simple rules. First, always put at least 20% down when you buy a car. Second, never finance the car for longer than 48 months. Following these two steps will keep you from spending thousands of dollars extra on interest over the length of your auto loan.. Now, think about how much you plan to have available for a down payment, ready to leave your bank account entirely on the day you drive off with your new car. For a $50k car, that would be $10k. That's quite a bit of savings, even for someone with a great job. That means you have $40k left to finance. If we assume 2% interest (less if you've got great credit, more if not), and if we maximize our responsible loan length at 48 months, we're looking at $868/month over 4 years.. So, ask yourself:Can I spend $10k right away as a down payment, and can I commit to over $850/month for 4 years for this car, not including maintenance, repairs, fuel, insurance, etc? If we look at a $35k car instead, your down payment becomes only $7k and your monthly payment is only $607.. So those are your steps. Figure out how expensive the car you want will be, then consider if you can spend 20% as a down payment, and use an online car loan calculator to see if you can afford a loan for the remaining 80% over 48 months. If you feel confident in the numbers, you will probably have made a fiscally responsible choice..

1202,IKnowNewCars," If you can put down 60-70%, by all means go for it. The only reason I wouldn't do that is if you could get a really good interest rate on the car (1% or less) and invest your money elsewhere where returns would be higher (a decently balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds will average 3-4% or more per year, but you already know that I'm sure).. At that point it's entirely up to you:would you feel better paying off your car faster and having less debt, or keeping a bigger auto loan while maximizing your returns by investing elsewhere? I'd pick the former, because having less debt would make me very happy right about now, but Warren Buffett would probably tell you to go the other route..

1205,FujenDale," Test drove a 18' IS 350 F Sport. Pros:Loved the car, handling, interior. Cons:Infotainment system, the joy sticks is annoying and honestly weird. With trade and money down (42% total) it would still be 650/month for 48 months(0% interest as well). I was hoping for more towards 500/month but I only want a 4 year loan, nothing more. If the joystick is the only thing I dont like it, im not sure how much i would actually use it, more of a set and forget type of things.  Is 1 thing that big of a deal? I can afford 650/month. Sorry for the post but theres a 16' with 15k miles which would only be 303/month (putting the same amount down). Only thing the 16' doesnt have is premium sound system, and lane departure warning. I have not checked out the 16' set as it is an hour+ away from me. Thoughts?.

1206,IKnowNewCars," Infotainment can go either way. Lots of great cars have frustrating infotainment systems these days, but you can sort of ignore it if you aren't gonna be doing too many fancy things with it often. The easy answer would be to test drive some of its competitors and see how their infotainment systems compare!. The other thing I would say is that spending more than you want for a car that has a feature that could annoy you on a daily basis is a tough sell. If you're gonna go over budget, make sure you're spending it on something perfect. You can find cars for less money that aren't as reliable as an IS350 F Sport, but if you're saving 150/month over 48 months, that's $7200, which is probably enough to make up for any increased repair and maintenance costs for a less reliable car.. Having said that:the 2016 IS350 F Sport sounds like it could be a great deal, assuming you have a mechanic or other car dude check it out and make sure it's in good shape. The 2017 model added standard active safety, and the 2018 model added an extra 5 HP and a limited-slip differential for IS350 F Sport RWD models, but neither of those are worth the extra $10k+ for a brand new 2018 over a 2016 as long as it's been kept up well. I'd say it's worth checking out, if it appeals to you!. ",Sub_Content, 1 month ago,t1_dytmfzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8hmpcx/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

Right now that means I am leaning heavily towards the Porsche Macan because it's small enough that parking it in a city isn't a pain, large enough that I can still make trips up to the mountain with it and it handles better than just about any car I've driven (aside from that Ferrari but it was a 458 Italia that runs like 180K used) but I'm still looking for suggestions before I pull the trigger on the Porsche..

1226,Transmaniacon89," Macan would be an awesome choice, though I‚Äôd try to go for the GTS trim if you want to track it.. Going to be hard to find something with comparable space for trips, that also offers that kind of performance.. You could consider the Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT, but I think the Macan will handle better and is more compact as well..

Type of vehicle:  I'm deciding between a 2012 Hyunda Veloster Automatic w/ 70k miles for $8k or a 2005 Honda Element AWD w/ 72k miles for $9k. Must haves:  I'm mostly interested in fuel economy and cargo space. For sure the Element is going to excel in carrying capacity, but after driving a gas guzzling pathfinder for so long, I'm eager to get something leaner and more economical. That's where the veloster excels. Despite it's much smaller cargo space, I'm hoping the hatchback with folded rear seats will be enough. I can add roof racks and a cargo box if needed.. Desired transmission:  Auto. Intended use:  Daily Driver, Adventure Car, Roadtrips, Camping. Vehicles you've already considered:  Element, Outback, Civic Hatchback, Veloster, Fit, Prius.

Do you need a Warranty:  No. Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:  No. Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:  No. Additional Notes:I really like both cars.

1268,IKnowNewCars," For an AWD vehicle in your budget range, a crossover is probably ideal. Here are the main ones I'd have you check out: Honda CR-V. Probably the most well-rounded in its class. Does everything pretty well, and it's reliable to boot. Test drive an AWD CR-V in EX trim for $29k MSRP and see how you like it.. Mazda CX-5. My personal favorite crossover in its price range, because it's simply more fun to drive than its competitors. It's also very nice looking, inside and out. Its back seat and cargo area are smaller than the CR-V, though, and reliability may be a bit lower. An AWD CX-5 in Touring trim with the Preferred Equipment package will be very close in price to the CR-V EX AWD.. Hyundai Tucson. Hyundai's reliability has been great and their warranties are some of the best on the market. They also make great vehicles, and the Tucson is one of them, giving you a lot for the money. The Tucson Value trim is the one to get, coming with its quickest, most efficient powertrain and a lot of standard features, coming in at $29k MSRP w/ AWD, right in line with the others.. Kia Sportage. Kia shares a lot with Hyundai, including reliability and warranty, and while the Tucson Value has a better engine, the Sportage has a more upscale interior feel. The Sportage EX w/ AWD is just under $29k MSRP.. Volkswagen Golf Alltrack. If you want AWD but want to consider something that's not technically a crossover, this wagon is just the ticket. It's gonna be more fun to drive than the other options here, fuel efficient, and spacious, with an upscale feel inside. AWD is standard on the Alltrack, and the base S trim has a lot to offer for only $28k MSRP. Reliability isn't as high as the others, but it has one of the best warranties on the market for 2018 (6 years or 72k miles, bumper to bumper), so if you drive 20k miles a year, an Alltrack will stay entirely under warranty for almost 4 years, instead of almost 2 years like Honda and Mazda. For comparison, Hyundai and Kia offer 5 year/60k mile warranties, and will probably need fewer repairs than the VW after warranty is up.. Test drive some of these and see which ones you like!.

1271,IKnowNewCars," Tiguans, Altimas, and Civics are all very different cars, particularly in terms of interior space, cargo volume, and number of passengers. If you like the size of the Tiguan but aren't sure about reliability, there are lots of other options to consider! Answer a few questions for me: A Tiguan SE has an MSRP of $28k. Is that about the maximum budget you're looking at, or could you go up to $30k or higher?. The 2018 Tiguan has a 3rd row of seats, which is one of its biggest selling points for its size and price. Is this important to you? Would you need to carry people in a 3rd row often? Or would it be helpful just for occasional use, like to shuttle kids around town?. Is having a flexible cargo area important? With a crossover like the Tiguan, you can fold down the 3rd row of seats (and even the 2nd row if needed) to carry big stuff. Is that needed, or would a big trunk like one in an Accord or Altima be good enough? Or would a Civic's small trunk be fine?. Is there any other reason you might need or want a crossover? Do you prefer a higher seating position, or require some bad-weather or off-road capability?.

1274,BruhChillz," The Tiguans at my local dealership for the second from highest trim with most goodies you really need (the SE as you say) is around $23,000 which I thought is insanely good value. I think I‚Äôd only go maximum $25,000. For me the third row is just something occasionally helpful but I don‚Äôt really need it. Gives ton of extra cargo space again which I don‚Äôt need everyday but useful. But I could definitely surivive with the accord or Altima or civic cause that extra space is more just very occasional. Personally I guess I wanted the crossover for the higher seating position which is very nice I love that and cause it‚Äôs bigger... very American mentality I guess lol.. ",Sub_Content, 1 month ago,t1_dyriv8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8hmpcx/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
1275,IKnowNewCars," If you like the higher seating position, there's no reason not to go for a crossover these days, there are honestly so many good ones out there given their popularity. The new Tiguan isn't my favorite (since it got so big, it's not quite as fun or nimble to drive as the old one), but it represents a solid value given its interior space. Especially for that price!. The other nice thing about VW these days is that they've added the 6 year/72k mile bumper-to-bumper warranty to (almost) all 2018 models. At $23k and with that warranty, I think a Tiguan SE meets your needs pretty well! Just keep in mind, after the warranty expires in 2024, repairs may be more frequent than the average car (and more expensive). So that's up to you.. If you're interested in some other crossovers like the Tiguan, most in that price range won't have the 3rd row, but they may still have enough interior space for you:Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, Hyundai Tucson, Kia Sportage, etc. The Japanese and Korean choices will be more reliable, while the Ford Escape can be had with big dealer discounts as well. If you want another three-row option, check out the Kia Sorento and see how cheap the dealership will offer you a three-row model for (the base models come with only 2 rows).. If you decide to go the Sedan route, my recommendations would be a Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Mazda 6, Hyundai Sonata, Kia Optima, or Chevy Malibu. The Civic is a solid option, but it's quite a bit smaller than the mid-size options I've listed here, so you'd be giving up a lot, especially in comparison to a Tiguan. The Altima is a fine choice since Nissan offers bigger discounts than many other brands, but their reliability hasn't been as good lately as it used to be..

1277,IKnowNewCars," So, to summarize:You want a sports sedan as a daily driver for $50k or less. Are those your only requirements? If so, here are my recommendations as far as new cars go: Alfa Romeo Giulia. Definitely my favorite sports sedan on the market right now. It's fantastic in nearly every way, except for uncertain reliability. Test drive a Giulia Ti Sport w/ the Performance Package and staggered summer tires. MSRP = $45k. Audi S3. Basically, it's a VW Golf R in luxury sedan form. The back seat and trunk are small, but if you want performance and fun in a sedan, it's very hard to beat for the money (0-60 in 4.6 seconds, for starters). Test drive an S3 in Premium Plus trim w/ S Sport package. MSRP = $46k. Audi A4. If you like Audi and want something more spacious, the A4's performance might surprise you. 0-60 in 5.1 seconds isn't bad for an ""entry luxury sedan."" Test drive an A4 Quattro (252 HP engine, and I'd pick the manual transmission) in Premium Plus trim w/ Sport package and no-cost 18"" summer tires. MSRP = $45k. Kia Stinger GT. The Stinger offers more interior space than any of its competitors, and the GT Model offers crazy speed for the price (0-60 in 4.4 seconds) with surprising handling chops. Test drive a Stinger GT1 for the best blend of performance and value. MSRP = $44k. (If the Kia badge bothers you, wait for the Genesis G70! Same platform and engines as the Kia, plus a manual transmission offered with the base engine and an overall lighter, more nimble chassis.). Mercedes-Benz C300. Mercedes still makes some of the best interiors out there, and while they may not be as sporty as BMW or as well-rounded as Audi, their steering is sharp and their cars look upscale. If you want to go sporty, test drive a C300 w/ AMG Line. MSRP = $43k. BMW 330i. I haven't been overly impressed with the 3-series lately, but if you want a RWD sports sedan, it's hard not to at least try one out! Test drive a 330i M Sport, and I'd tick the manual transmission box as well. MSRP = $46k.

1278,_Hnnng_," Thanks for your recommendations.. I have seen an Alfa Romeo drive by me once and it did make me look twice at it. Not sure about the performance or interior though, haven't seen it.. I test drove an Audi A3 and hated the interior. Didn't look like anything special, more bland.. Yeah, I can't get past the Kia badge lol and don't care much for the genesis series either.. I like the look of the Mercedes C300 and C63, but I've never test drove a Mercedes and I've heard they can cost a lot for maintenance. That'd be my only grip about them but I have though a lot about getting one.. Test drove a 3 series and 4 series BMW and same as the Audi, did care much for the interior but I must say that I find the 3 series the most aesthetically pleasing than the 4 series or either the A3 or A4.

1279,IKnowNewCars," The Alfa is an incredibly special car. It's hard to explain. It offers a very passionate driving experience. You've gotta take it for a test drive. The interior is very nice, though the back seat is a bit more cramped than an A4 or 3-series. The 280 HP engine sounds fantastic, and while 0-60 in 5.7 seconds doesn't seem fast, when you're driving it down a windy road you honestly don't care. It's just too fun.. If you could afford a C43, I'd definitely have you check one out, but even so, the C300 is fairly well balanced. It's not as fun to drive as its competitors, but it's no slouch, and the interior and exterior are both very classy.. Once you test drive a few more of these, let us know what you think!.

Previously I had a 2010 model, and have now been driving a 2013 since late 2015. Recently, my dad mentioned that he wants to get the current, facelifted R231 and asked whether I wanted to buy his current 2015 SL63 off of him. I told him I'd consider it, but have to say, for the first time, I'm not really sure I do. I've also been getting that new car itch the past few months and replacing a 2013 SL63 with a 2015 SL63 probably wouldn't quite cut it. Don't be mistaken, I love my current car and I don't really need to switch, but I wouldn't mind trying something different either.. I consider myself a bit of a petrolhead, and I have some ideas as far as what cars I could go for, but it's also nice to hear from people who are impartial in the matter, which is where you lot come in. : I'm now on my 3rd Benz (SLK230K and 2x SL63), so it's obvious I quite like the brand, but I'm not averse to trying out new things..

1290,grilled_tits," My Mercedes experience has been pretty great overall. My SLK is a 1998, so it had a few small issues, like a wonky MAF sensor or the alternator giving out, but weirdly for a 1998 Benz - no rust.. Both my SLs have been perfect, no repairs needed whatsoever, just regular maintenance. The 2010 had around 80k km on the odo when sold, and my current 2013 is approaching 70k, both with 0 issues. 1 unusual thing is they seem to eat through tyres at a considerably faster rate than regular cars. The 2010 was heavy on all 4 tyres, while the 2013 seems to be mostly munching the rears, which I guess is understandable.. Since 1998 when my dad bought his first SL the only issue he had was an ignition coil dying on his 2006 SL55, which also lead to a catalytic converter being destroyed. The car might have been just out of warranty at that point (I'm not really sure about that though), but Mercedes ended up fixing it for free.. The thing I'm slightly tired of is how many people I get trying to challenge me or race me off the lights. It's annoying and can be dangerous..

1308,FakeTakiInoue," I have a very low tolerance for SUV's, but my dad is a bit more lenient. Overall, he tends to prefer wagons/estates.. Annoyingly, the Mazdas 6, Mercs E-Class and Skoda's Superb we found in The Netherlands were generally a bit too expensive. I hope this is just a temporary thing, because I almost got him to buy a Mazda instead of our current V70. The Superb's space is, er, superb.. The Octavia warrants a more thorough search into that model, looking at this one. Do modern DSG's last? And, more importantly, do older DSG's like the one in an older Superb last?.

1309,AUSMEL351," I found all of those Estates in Germany. I'm not sure if there is a tax on importing a car from Germany into the Netherlands however but it is significantly easier to find one in Germany than it was in the Netherlands.. In terms of the DSG, browsing on the internet, it seems that the DSG is more reliable these days. Only the earlier ones (2004-08) had issues. The newer ones are mostly reliable with (few) problems. With the older ones (6-Speed DSG), it needs to be serviced every 60,000 km (will depend on car, so check the books for the service interval).

That being said. No car is probably worth your relationship with your fianc√© or your own stress levels.

However, I‚Äôve gotten lucky with mine and all the money I‚Äôve put in has been completely cause I wanted to upgrade x y or z.. Anecdotally, I haven‚Äôt heard any scary stories about ZHP‚Äôs, which I have a theory for. Since they were such a special car, and the package required such core things to be different like the suspension set up, the engine being tweaked and other things. I feel like they got better attention in the factories and were put together without any hiccups. However, prior owner use is key. So if this is a private sale, then I‚Äôd have a good honest talk with the owner and you might be on a secret gem. If it‚Äôs a dealer, get that PPI before you negotiate price or anything.

1347,IKnowNewCars," Hmmm so we're looking for RWD sports sedans or sport coupes for $55k or less. A BMW 340i M Sport would come in right around $50k, or a 440i M Sport might be a bit more nimble but less practical for $55k or so. They both have turbo-6 engines that sound awesome, though I'm not sure how they compare to the M2 specifically in that sense. Should still be a blast to drive. The Mercedes-AMG C43 is fantastic and incredibly balanced for its $54k price tag, and if you want it to sound even meaner, add the $1200 Performance Exhaust option (yes, it's AWD, but it's rear-biased, so you're still getting more tail-out antics than you would with Quattro).. As weird as it might sound, a brand new Kia Stinger GT2, its top-level $50 trim, has just about everything you need to get a ton for your money in this market:a beautiful twin-turbo V6 that hits 0-60 in 4.4 seconds, a fairly nice interior with a hugely spacious back seat, chassis and suspension tuning led by the former director of BMW M, tons and tons of features, and better reliability and warranty than any German brand on the market. You might scoff at the idea of a Kia replacing a BMW, but it's definitely worth a test drive at the very least.. If performance is more important than luxury, your options expand. You can deck out a brand new 2018 Mustang GT Premium with the Performance Package, Active Exhaust, and MagneRide Suspension, and stay under $50k for a comfortable daily driver that's also an absolute blast to drive, a great performer, and can run 0-60 in 3.9 seconds with the optional 10-speed automatic. For the best in track-ready pony cars, the Chevy Camaro 2SS 1LE will absolutely be the best performing track-ready car you can buy for $50k. It's scary good. $55k will also get you a Mustang Shelby GT350, which has the best engine sound of any car I've listed here (by far), though if you want the Electronics package (ideal for a daily driver), you'll kick the price up to $58k.. Lastly, there's one killer RWD sedan in the non-luxury market (since the Chevy SS sedan was discontinued), and while the Charger may not be your thing, opting for one with the 6.4L 392 Hemi (485 HP) would be the best of both worlds with a spacious back seat and too-much-fun performance. A Charger R/T Scat Pack with Dynamics Package, P Zero Summer Tires, and Alcantara/Nappa leather seats would only run you $45k. For an active exhaust and even more comfortable seats, the Charger Daytona 392 (plus those summer tires) runs you almost $47k. And to deck it out with an adaptive suspension, Launch Control, heated and ventilated seats, and an absolutely killer look, the Charger SRT 392 (again, summer tires too please) will hit $53k. Sure, it's not a BMW. But it's more spacious than any other option mentioned here, it's got killer muscle, surprising track chops, and an absurd pushrod engine that might just make you forget all about the scalpel-like precision of the M2 you almost bought.. Or maybe the M2 is perfect for you. Who knows! There's a ton of options here and I recommend any of them..

1348,schtuck," Wow you really know your cars haha (username definitely checks out). The AMG's always sound super mean so that's definitely an option to look into but I've always been a Bimmer fanboy since my first car ('02 3-series) so I've come to appreciate the BMW balance quite a bit. Still, that exhaust note is ridiculous on the C43.. Definitely did not expect to see the Stinger on this list but the bigger backseat and reliability are a strong case for sure.. As for all the muscle cars, I've fallen in and out of love with them time and again but the new mustang GT is stupidly capable and sounds pretty fantastic with that v8. The GT350 with options is slightly out of my price range, unfortunately, but the GT is still a solid competitor. I've never liked the look of the Camaro or the Challenger though so I think those are going to have to go but the Charger is a pretty interesting proposition. I'd never even heard of the Scat Pack before but it seems like a solid deal for the amount of power you're getting plus 4 doors and tons more space than the M2. And it's probably louder too haha.. At the end of the day I'm still super partial to BMW but these choices are definitely some solid food for thought, it's going to come down to picking between the M2, the Stinger, Mustang and Charger I think. The only car I really looked into before this post was the M2 and I found a pretty decent one in the area that's already been wrapped in Satin Black, you can take a look at it . here. Do you think this is a decent deal? I'm gonna start looking into all the other ones you mentioned, especially the Charger, I think that's the strongest competitor at this point.

1349,IKnowNewCars," As soon as I see ""used"" and ""BMW"" in the same listing, I bow out, not because it's a bad call (it could be perfect for all I know), but because there are plenty of folks here who follow used Bimmers closely as prices fluctuate and as we learn more about the reliability of each model. So I'll defer to them on that.. I'm glad I could help! Definitely test drive all four of those options, the M2, a Stinger GT1 or GT2, a Mustang GT with Performance Package (and preferably the other performance options too), and one of the Charger trims with the 6.4L/392 Hemi. All four cars are very different, but they all do what they do very well. Once you have a better idea of how each one feels, sleep on it and go with your gut!

1350,anstormning," I just want to add in as a lurker of this post thanks for your opinions and advice.. I've been driving the same car I started driving with almost 9 years ago and I'm finally in the position to upgrade to something more modern. I also happen to live in California, however I don't know what my price range will be because it's still a few months away from happening (probably early Summer). Been leaning towards more sporty sedans like the C43, Stinger, Giulia, and RS3..

1351,IKnowNewCars," Thanks for the kind words! All the ones you mentioned are fantastic, no question, but of course they all have their ups and downs: The C43 will lean a bit more towards luxury and away from sporty driving character as compared to the others, but it's still absolutely one of my favorites.. The Stinger will miss a bit of the dialed-in handling and interior refinement of its European competitors, but it's simply awesome for the money, especially when you consider its crazy acceleration and passenger space, which kick butt vs the competition. Reliability and warranty too!. The Giulia is one of my favorite new sports sedans this year, and you can't really know why until you drive one. A Giulia Ti Sport w/ Performance Package and staggered summer tires comes out to almost $45k and gives you a truly unique driving experience, along with a splendid interior (besides the cramped back seats). Of course, reliability is a big question mark, but if you're leaning towards an Italian sports sedan, hopefully you're a car enthusiast who knows what you're getting yourself into!. The RS3, like I said before, strikes a balance with the M2 by adding 2 more doors, Quattro AWD, a more comfortable suspension setup (that still performs crazy well), and a faster powertrain. The M2 may have more soul in a sense, but the RS3 is a performance monster with a bit more practicality, loved by those who are thrilled more by speed than scalpel-like corner-carving precision. Though the RS3 does that pretty well too!. Out of the four you mentioned, I'd have a very hard time deciding. But you have some time to think about it. Maybe take a test drive or two when you have free time one weekend!. ",Sub_Content, 5 months ago,t1_dsdow4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7oxvox/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

Then I can buy an SS a couple years from now when prices drop more.  I know this isn't . /r/personalfinance. , but I want opinions.. I've been leaning toward the Caprice lately because I've read you can buy all the parts reauired for a 500hp LSA supercharger build for under $4000.

1403,IKnowNewCars," I'm a big fan of the Civic hatch, and it does sound like an EX w/ Sensing would be ideal if you could find one. Keep in mind that 2017 and 2018 models are identical, so you can look for both.. Having said all that, if safety is a priority, the place I would start is the . list of current IIHS Top Safety Picks..  Every year, IIHS makes it more and more difficult for manufacturers to earn a TSP award. This year, cars have to earn Good ratings on all required crash tests, Acceptable or higher for headlights, and Advanced or better for front crash prevention systems. (The Plus in Top Safety Pick+ comes from earning Acceptable or better in the optional passenger-side small overlap front crash test, plus a Good rating for headlights.). The Civic misses the TSP this year due to its Poor headlights rating, but every other caregory passed with flying colors. Sadly, nearly every vehicle that gets an award this year is over your $25k spending limit. The Kia Soul comes close, at $27k for the Plus (+) trim with Primo Lit package.. But you can compromise a bit on the Mazda 3:Even though the major autonomous features are only in the fully loaded model, every 2018 Mazda 3 hatch comes standard with Smart City Brake Support, which at least provides automated braking at city driving speeds. Get one in Touring trim and you stay in a very affordable price range while still getting a nice interior, or add the Bose package for some great additional features while still staying in budget. It's also a blast to drive with either transmission.. ",Sub_Content, 5 months ago,t1_dsdbsuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7oxvox/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

1410,BaronRaymondoEVIL," Full disclosure:I‚Äôve never managed to do what you‚Äôre attempting, at least not for long. Soon the siren song of a nicer car ‚Äî probably a German car ‚Äî will come calling and, if you‚Äôre like me, you will answer.. That being said, there are lots and lots of economical cars out there. Sure, that Camry hybrid will get good mileage, but you can do better and save more, if that‚Äôs the goal. An old, crappy 3-cylinder Suzuki Swift will cost next to nothing and use only 5.8 liters to go 100km. Now, that‚Äôs a nuclear option. There are many others, usually less extreme.. Point is, how much will you really be saving? You‚Äôve got to sell your existing car for a realistic figure and then buy another one. I wouldn‚Äôt make the move until you actually calculate it all out. When I‚Äôve run the numbers, I‚Äôm always shocked to discover that gas mileage isn‚Äôt a great way to save money. If you do sell, I‚Äôd recommend taking the difference and put it into a separate account or it will just evaporate.. Okay, so cars. Any Mazda sedan with Skyactiv will be great. Any reasonable sized hybrid will be great too. And really, any modern teeny 4-cylinder with a turbo will be great too.

1412,IKnowNewCars," Affordable, practical, and cool all converge around Sport Compacts like the WRX and GTI. 4 doors, sometimes a hatch, lots of driving fun, decent price. The WRX is an obvious choice, given that it's the only AWD sport compact in your price range, but I'd recommend you read what I . wrote earlier. , advising someone in a similar situation to decide whether they really need AWD. Believe me, AWD adds peace of mind during the winter, but the WRX is certainly imperfect as a daily driver, so you don't wanna rule out FWD choices. If you have the means of swapping in snow tires during winter, bring some more FWD choices into the mix:GTI, Civic Si, Focus ST, Elantra GT Sport.. FWD is a lot better in the snow than RWD, so if that's a concern, it would behoove you to avoid the Mustang, Charger, etc. There are other FWD options out there that are pretty spacious and pretty fun, like the new 2018 Honda Accord Sport 2.0T with a manual transmission for $31k.

1414,DanteAtWork, I'll second the WRX with the caveat that it is not the most comfortable for long rides due to how you feel every bump in the road and the engine/exhaust noise is on the loud side (but I've heard the 2018s have more insulation and thicker glass to help with this).. ,Sub_Content, 5 months ago,t1_dsdxkt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7oxvox/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
1415,IKnowNewCars," In the link to the earlier comment, I talk about how the WRX has some issues as a comfortable daily driver, with harsh ride quality as the biggest downside in my opinion. They did improve a lot in the 2018, but simply put, people who are looking into a WRX but don't know what they're getting themselves into need to do a thorough test drive and make sure they'll be happy using the car as a daily driver/road trip car..

1419,IKnowNewCars," VW knows their reputation for reliability has been unfortunate in recent years. That's why they've extended their warranty to 6 years/72k miles starting with 2018 models. That makes the GTI a bit more practical than it otherwise might be. A 2018 GTI in SE trim will have all the performance upgrades of the current Sport model, plus leather seats and some nice features, for around $30k MSRP (VW's been giving big discounts on GTIs, though, so $27k is definitely possible).. I like the Civic Hatch, especially the Sport trim with a manual transmission. You'll save a lot of money vs the GTI. It won't be as nice inside, or have as many features, or be quite as fun to drive. But you'll have better reliability, still a great balance between a comfortable/practical daily driver and a fun car to drive, and more money in your pocket when all is said and done. If you want something more fun, a Civic Si would be a little less practical (sedan, no hatchback), but the performance is definitely there. A Ford Focus ST might be considering too, since they're well-priced, powerful, and Ford gives big discounts and incentives, more so than VW even. (If you get a Focus ST, make sure it has Sync 3 and Recaros, but make sure the Recaros are comfortable for you first!).

1420,Svc335," This is so helpful, thank you! I didn't realize VW's been giving discounts, that should really help. I keep thinking about the Civic SI, but the hatchback body style is so much attractive to me on the Civic vs the Sedan. Also this is kinda vain but where I live the new civic sedan is one of the most populous cars on the road and I'd like a bit of uniquness with the hatch. Other than the reliability factor, the GTI has all the boxes ticked for what I want in a vehicle..

1421,IKnowNewCars," Put it this way:There are lots of Sport Compacts to choose from these days. I didn't even list all of them here, just the ones I really recommend right now. They all have their ups and downs. But there is something special about the GTI. Test drive all of them, and if you really love the GTI more than the rest, then sleep on it and figure out if you're willing to put up with more repairs after the 6 year mark. If you're like me and you love cars and driving, you'd rather buy a car you truly love to drive than one you don't, just because you're sure one will break less. And worse come to worse, you can always sell the GTI after 6 years if you're unsure!.

1425,dogpaddle," Location:  North Mississippi. Price range:  $2-4k. Type of vehicle:  preferably a small car but maybe not, I'd rather not get a truck or something large. see below. Must haves:  a really strong, reliable suspension. decent gas mileage, at least average in the mid 20's. Desired transmission:  auto. Intended use:  Delivery driving. Lots of hills, traffic, speed bumps, potholes, and highways. Vehicles you've already considered:  looking at mid 2000's buicks purely for the bulletproof 3800, cheapness and availability. I have no idea how well the suspensions hold up, and it doesn't look so good from the examples of clapped out ones I've seen. which leads to... Is this your 1st vehicle:  Right now I've got an 08 focus, 06 focus before that, 05 focus before that, and it doesn't really matter after that. I love my focuses (focii?) but I can't keep up on the maintenance. ends up being cheaper to buy a new car than try and fix one that's falling apart and risk losing my job. Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:  I can do about 70% of minor work. Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:  not so much. Additional Notes:  really just wondering if there's a cheap car out there with a solid suspension that could handle the rigors of delivery driving while also being cheap to maintain/fuel. got my eye out for a granny car in the meantime. google hasn't really been much help..

1442,IKnowNewCars," If you want a crossover/SUV for the ride height and AWD, but not necessarily for cargo space, there are lots of ""cute utes,"" aka small crossovers that might fit the bill perfectly. I know you already have a CX-5, but the CX-3 is a great way to get a very fun-to-drive, comfortable little crossover in your price range. The base Sport model will stay under $23k, but the Touring trim adds a lot of nice features (heated seats come to mind), and you can probably get one for under $23k with a little haggling (or go CPO to save a few thousand).. The Crosstrek is definitely slow, but the 2018 redesign at least makes for a comfortable, fairly enjoyable driving experience. I wish they did a bit better on the engine and transmission though. Sadly, even solid alternatives like the Nissan Rogue Sport, Jeep Renegade, or surprisingly well-priced Buick Encore are all fairly slow (manufacturers have found you can get away with a slow powertrain in a tiny crossover and still see huge sales). At least with the CX-3, its decent-at-best acceleration (faster than most competitors, but still not quick) can be forgiven due to its truly enjoyable driving dynamics and responsive transmission.. Decent acceleration can be found in the Honda CR-V and Subaru Forester XT, though you won't find them in your price range brand-new with decent options. And if you get the CR-V, you'll find it's far more spacious than your CX-5 even, so you and your wife may end up trading! (Personally, I'd take the CX-5 over almost any of these, as it's one of my favorite crossovers on the market. It's just impressively fun to drive.).

And the infotainment systems they have on these newer models are awesome.

1444,IKnowNewCars," Ooof. I'm not a fan of financial fuckery. Since you left a down payment, I recommend heading to a local credit union and getting a quote for an auto loan for the same amount you're financing (bottom line cost minus down payment). You may get a lower interest rate, and they should be very straightforward about payments and such. You can use that as leverage when you go back to the dealership, and if they're still practicing fuckery, just go with the credit union and you're set!.

1457,IKnowNewCars," Your decision here will depend on what lease deals you can get for each model. But I will say that the Civic is probably my favorite compact on the market right now, so it's hard to go wrong there. Following close behind is the VW Golf, then the Mazda 3. The Hyundai Elantra and Elantra GT are both solid for the money as well. If you want to go American, the Chevy Cruze is a better option this year than the Ford Focus, which hasn't been updated in a while. I'd avoid the Nissan Sentra, as there are plenty of other cars that are so much better for the money.. Test drive a few of these, get some lease offers from the dealerships, then come back and tell us what you've found. We can help you choose between them, but ultimately, how you feel during the test drives will be the biggest indicator. There are so many compacts on the market which are great for the price, I'm sure you'll find one you love in your budget!.

1465,IKnowNewCars," Fastest 0-60 as possible? That's easy:2018 Mustang GT with 10-speed automatic transmission and Performance Package. Now the cheapest this configuration would come is $41,585 MSRP, but I highly recommend going with the Mustang GT Premium trim, and also adding the Active Exhaust and MagneRide suspension. That brings the MSRP to $48k, but you'll have a car with a surprisingly comfortable and livable interior, a very flexible suspension that can adjust its firmness on the fly to Comfort, Sport, and Track modes, an exhaust that can also change on the fly to Quiet, Normal, Sport, and Track modes, and the kind of performance you'd have to pay a lot more for if it came from a luxury brand. I have no idea what sort of lease deals you'll get for it, but I do know that if you put 20% down and got a good interest rate on a 48-month loan to finance a purchase of this Mustang config, you'd be paying less than $800/month anyway. So I have to imagine a least rate would be a good bit less than that.. If you decide to go the luxury route instead, my favorite of those is the AMG C43, followed by the S3, then the Stinger GT, then the 340i M Sport. But they're all great, so it really just depends on which you like best after a few test drives and which you can get the beast lease deal on. However, none of them are as fast as the Mustang GT now.. ",Sub_Content, 5 months ago,t1_dsflb93,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7oxvox/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

1470,IKnowNewCars," Choosing between the Civic Hatch and Elantra GT Sport is gonna come entirely down to personal preference. The Civic Hatch will have a more comfortable ride quality and probably feel more refined when it comes to steering and chassis tuning. Best fuel economy in its class, too.The top-level Sport Touring trim is great if you can afford it, as it has all available features plus wider wheels, a quicker steering ratio, and other sporty additions. The Elantra GT Sport will be faster for the money, leather seats come standard, and it will be tuned to be more sporty and nimble (though it won't perform as well as, say, a Civic Si sedan)..

Just so much you can do with 'em, tons of parts out there, huge racing and autox'ing community, etc etc. And great resale; they never go away, just get passed from gearhead to gearhead.. OTOH, some others would be a bit more practical in terms of roominess.. And I wouldn't focus on power. You're looking at cars that handle themselves well in twisties, not stoplight racing.

But I'm less keen on those days, so am considering waiting for a 3-4 year old Jaguar I-Pace now, or for whatever other electric sedans come out in the coming years.  Given that, I'm playing with the idea of trading in the current car for something else for the intermediate period.  Wouldn't need to be a huge upgrade, but maybe just something different for variety.  That said, the BMW has depreciated to something like 11k-13k CAD, and I'm not sure we'll find anything that's even comparable without spending a ton more, which seems like a waste.  (Unless we went for a similar 10ish year old sedan, but then we're trading a car that we know has been well maintained for one that's more of a mystery.)  Still, this thread is fun, so figured I'd throw this up there and see if anyone has any ideas!.

1504,IKnowNewCars," Toyota is certainly gonna be the most reliable still, but the Rav4 just isn't a very exciting vehicle these days. It's certainly practical, safe, pretty spacious and a responsible choice, but the engine is fairly slow and not that efficient, driving dynamics are dull, the infotainment system isn't great, etc.. I certainly prefer the CR-V, which is one of the most well-rounded crossovers on the market. More spacious than the Rav4 in terms of cargo space, more fuel efficient than anything else in its class, a pleasure to drive, nice interior, etc. Honda's reliability isn't at Toyota level, but it's still above average, and the car should easily last 5 years in tip-top shape with proper maintenance. The EX AWD model is a great deal for $29k MSRP, but the EX-L and Touring add lots of great features if you have the money and want the features..

1506,IKnowNewCars," I mean, it's always possible to buy a reliable car that doesn't last as long as you want it to, and vice versa. My 2002 Mustang has 155k miles on it and is showing no signs of slowing. I'd put my money on a properly maintained CR-V beating the 200k mile mark.. And regardless, driving a car you enjoy for 200k miles is so worth it vs a car you're not crazy about over the same time/distance. I have a buddy who had an expensive repair to do on his 200k+ mile 1999 Rav4 (his first such repair in ages, apparently), and he decided it was time to get a new car, so he got a 2018 Rav4. After driving it for a week, he decided to pay the money to repair his 1999 and has been driving it for months while his brand new Rav4 sits in his garage. He just doesn't like driving it. He still wants a new car, but he wishes he went for a CR-V or Forester. This is entirely personal preference and circumstantial, so I don't want to turn you off from a Rav4 if you decide it's right for you, but make sure you have a thorough test drive or two before you make your decision!.

1515,TempestNathan," One thing to keep in mind is that it's almost always going to be cheaper overall to buy a car ~3 years old, even if you need to pay for the occasional repair.  You don't get a warranty, but you'll save like half the value of the car in depreciation.  So IE you can buy a new car for $40k and have a warranty to cover repairs, or you can buy almost the same car three years old for ~20k, and maybe, if you're unlucky, spend a few thousand in repairs that would have otherwise been covered by warranty.  Obviously you (or your mom) still end up way better off!. ",Sub_Content, 27 days ago,t1_dzna65d,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8l00uc/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

1527,TempestNathan," Yeah, the wagons are an acquired taste for sure.  I think you have the right idea thinking about trunk size‚Äîdo you really need the space of an SUV?  I've got two kids (6 and 3) and our family car has been a BMW 5-Series sedan.  No problems fitting strollers and everything in there.  For longer road trips we got a roof rack and cargo pod.  (If you compare the cargo space of a large sedan to an SUV you'll find it's much closer than you'd think.). If you're looking at BMW, I'd be thinking 3 or 5 series rather than 4 (as nice looking as the 4 is) if you're planning to use the back seats a lot.  5 will give more led and cargo room, whereas 3 is a bit smaller and sportier.. Or if you really want an SUV, maybe a Mercedes-Benz GLA 45 AMG.  Looks like an SUV but handles like a (really sporty) car.  At my last track day there was a guy turning some really fast laps in a nearly stock one.. https:/www.autotempest.com/results?make=mercedesbenz&amp;model=gla45amg&amp;zip=&amp;radius=any.

1537,EightSip," Just picked it up yesterday, dropped it off at the mechanic the same day because the front fenders were falling off, there was an oil leak (fixed now, was a seal that was leaking) and the back tires were out of balance (caused the car to vibrate between 55-65 mph.) Easy fixes, but still. :. Also, I discovered that the odometer was rolled back. Honestly not very surprised by this, since used cars salesmen are scumbags. Based from what I saw on the autocheck, the car actually has ~240,000 miles. Moron who sold me it even provided an odometer disclosure with the current odometer reading (obviously incorrect) so I have grounds to sue. But the car still runs fine, the brakes feel brand new and under the hood looks nice and clean like it has new parts (some of them are new.). Obviously I should have done my homework more.. Even then, given that I maintain and service it more, you think it'll last a good year or two? I plan to upgrade and sell when I graduate college.

1539,EightSip," The auto check showed that the first title had a mileage of ~230K (don't have the paper on me atm so can't provide exact number), and the next title had something ~115K. The odometer currently reads ~127K. I am the 3rd owner of the car. The auto check also showed something like ""not included in roll back calculation"" and stated that the odometer wasn't tampered with? I'll show you a picture of this tomorrow. Car had no signs of major wear and tear, both in the underbelly of the car and under the hood when I checked it out. Crazy! I don't know what to think of it. Even then, believe it or not, $3500 is a ""fair deal"" for a 240K 05 Accord in my area. I've seen ones priced around this number with similar mileage. A 127K Accord should really cost 5 to 6K.

1564,Drunken_Hamster," Many people think that RWD is bad for the snow, but it's a common misconception. No drive train is 'bad' for snow as long as you have snow tires at all 4 corners.. https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=STaximkaQxo. Whatever happens, be sure to get a set of smaller wheels [the smallest that your brakes will clear] with higher profile, skinnier[as they usually are] snow tires for the slick months. IE, with the Golf R as an example, stock summer tires would be 235/35r19, and a set of winter snow tires could be 215/50R17 or so.. Use this site to find similar sizes in diameter to stock for your snow tires compared to your street tires. https:/www.tacomaworld.com/tirecalc. Anyway, I'm currently considering the Mustang, myself, but I live in Florida and I'm looking at the Ecoboost. Much better fuel economy, and, reportedly, if you throw a few g's at it, it can make GT levels of power with no problems. Not to mention how it'll make MORE torque at that level AND be a lighter platform than the GT.. But I've been to the dealership a few times to sit in them, and the back seats are atrocious. I'm 6'1-ish and 285 lbs and I would NOT sit in the back. If I did, a front passenger of equal size to me would have to be scooted up slightly more than they'd probably want to be, and that's not even counting the fact that I'd have to lean to the side and bend my head over to clear the roof.. At best, the back seats are for children or people under 5'6, and possible even smaller. My plan is to take them out entirely if I were to get the car. Maybe put a nice sub box there or something.. Anyway, as far as possibilities in that category go, you could also go with a Fiesta/Focus ST. Both of those have seemingly the exact same seating space as far as leg room goes, the focus is just wider, perhaps a bit taller, and has more cargo space behind the rear seats. It also felt a bit nicer. My big butt with the driver's seat adjusted to me was fine behind myself in either, but wouldn't go on a long trip like that. The progression from there is the Focus RS, but I've heard some bad things about their drivelines.. WRX and EVO are on the next tier up, I'd say. They've been around forever and have the formula down pact, but I've heard bad things about the Subie motors getting rod knock and blowing, and the weak drivetrains on the EVOs. Beware and look into it, I suppose.. There's the Ford Taurus SHO, but that's more sedan-like. Could be a good thing if you want to lean towards comfort first and performance second with handling likely not being all there. I haven't sat it one, but, again, it's bigger so I'd assume more comfortable.. Long post man, I know. Take a water break right now, lol. This is what happens when you're me and you analyze everything to a T like 150 times AND have ADHD and OCD at the same time, haha. But I bet the detailed shit IS appreciated. After all, you've got to consider every aspect for a major decision like this, and personal accounts and/oor deep analysis is a godsend.. Had yer drink?. Good.. You always got the Charger/Challenger. Not light cars, I'll admit, but big, huge, and fucking fast. Especially if you get the right tires on them and the Hellcat, or, god forbid, the Demon. Not possible at 35k, but you could find a nice 5.7 for that much, I'd say. Getting a '15 or newer will leave you with the most up to date body style of either. And, if you get the GT models, those have optional{I believe} AWD. Only problem is the V6 not being as powerful as the V8. But you can always do the RIPP supercharger route if you're a car guy and intend to mod.... I've had a personal account of poor build quality with Chrysler, though. My current 05 Ram is giving me issues and a friend had an 06 Magnum that had stupid little things break like the defrost vents for the side windows randomly popping out and cracking one day. Obviously, that's pre-bailout. You know, back before the economy shat itself and GM and Chrysler took government cash to survive? Yeah, after that era around 08-'10, common cars improved in quality all around.. Back to AWD, there's the Golf R that makes out better than waffles. You can get them in FWD, too, or, at least, the next model down you can. Haven't heard anything bad about them so far and I know a guy who's owned 2. Just as with any new 4-cyl turbo, a tune alone can net you up to another 100HP and ft-lbs. Move to bolt ons, and you're talking up to another 50 of each. Slightly bigger turbo, another 50. These turbo cars have quite a lot of potential if you're looking to mod, dude, which leads me to my next thought.... The Genesis Coupe. Can't attest to the back seat on this, but I've heard another personal account on the 2.0T motor being strong. Dude had a friend who built it up to DOUBLE its original spec and was solid. He also said the 3.8, while more powerful than the 2.0T stock, can't handle power mods and blows up. Ouch. So defo go for the 2.0T. le sigh. I'm done, bro. Aside from saying that if you want top dog reliability, stick with Honda, Toyota, and their associates. Which means that despite me having no experience with the Type R, it looks very good on paper, and Honda has the track record {both literally and metaphorically} to back it up. The Stinger GT seems great, but Kias of long ago were crap, weren't they? I'd say wait on that for a couple of years like most people do with the 'latest and greatest'.. Stay away from Euro costs IMO. What you get in luxury and performance, I'd say you lose in service and parts costs. The Golf GTI/R are still great though. Entirely up to you.

1583,IKnowNewCars," There are a crazy number of options in that class of luxury SUV/crossovers these days, and most of them are great, so it does come down to personal preference on a lot of it. But I'll tell you my favorites and why. (FYI, I'm not familiar with CAD pricing, so if anything ends up out of your price range, I apologize!). Porsche Macan. It's the best-driving crossover in its class, period. Sure, it's not as big as others in its class, which may make it less practical. But driving it can put a smile on anyone's face who cares at all about driving fun and performance. The Macan S is the ideal balance of power and value if you can afford it, but the base Macan is still a blast and worth every penny. Options can raise the price quickly, so really think about what features you want and need.. Audi Q5. Audi has done a great job of balancing sporty driving character, luxury interiors, and up-to-date tech in pretty much all of their vehicles lately, and the Q5 is no exception. Not sure about Canadian trim levels, but in the US every trim level is worth the money (including the fancy Prestige trim), so pay what you can for the features you want. If you want a more exciting driving experience, the SQ5 is quicker and sportier, and again, each trim level is worth the money. Adding the S Sport package to the SQ5 is worth it too, especially for the air suspension.. Alfa Romeo Stelvio. Similar to the Italian flair that the Giulia brought to the sports sedan scene last year, the Stelvio is doing that for luxury crossovers this year. Fun to drive, stylish, and more unique than most. Reliability is iffy, but test driving it might reveal that it's worth it. Opting for the Stelvio Ti Sport really brings out its best performance.. BMW X3. The current X3 is just as awesome as it used to be, if not more so. They did a nice job of incorporating the sporty demeanor of the 3-series into this crossover. Choosing a trim and options is up to you, but my one recommendation would be to make sure it has the optional Dynamic Damper Control, an awesome adaptive suspension system. The base 30i engine is more than enough for most folks.. Mercedes-AMG GLC43. The GLC300 is a nice crossover, but it isn't super exciting, has a fairly small cargo hold, and besides having a nicer interior it doesn't really beat the X3 at much. Having said that, the AMG GLC43 is on another level. It's fast, it handles so well, it's just all-around fun. And still luxurious. Tack on whatever packages you want and can afford, but try to include the Burmester audio system, and if you want the best performance, opt for the 21-inch wheels (which come with nice summer tires).. Jaguar F-Pace. Like a lot of Jaguars on the market today, it offers a playful driving experience, but this one couples it with practicality, offering a spacious interior and cargo area. It has its flaws, though:ride quality is harsh, the infotainment system is weird, and its interior refinement doesn't quite reach the level of Mercedes, for example. But if you can afford the high-end F-Pace S, its 380 HP engine and capable suspension will make you forget about those things very quickly.. Of the ones you mentioned, I didn't include the Velar, but that's not because it's bad. It's honestly a very nice SUV. It's just more expensive than the others, yet its engine choices aren't the best, its infotainment system is overwhelming, and it's not as much fun to drive (in my opinion). But the luxury, interior materials, practicality, tech features, and overall beauty of the Velar are very impressive regardless. If you want to test drive one and aren't sure which to try (Range Rover's trim levels are very confusing), start with the R-Design P250 SE and go from there..

1586,RolfIsSonOfShepnard, Mazda 3 Touring or Honda Civic EX-T? Both are priced about the same before options. The civic has like 10 less hp but the fuel efficiency is a lot better for city and highway. It's going to be a daily driver and my commute now is 7 miles both way but will soon change to 12 miles. Location is in northern NJ and will be used daily. Current job is also delivering food but I have no idea how long it'll last though I'll definitely have it over the entire summer at least. I haven't test driven and yet but from what I have seen the touring is more luxurious on the inside but that's about it. I'll try to test them both next week but id like to know if there is a better option out there in that 20-22k area or if one of the 2 cars is just starlight up better.

1589,IKnowNewCars," First thing's first:The Subaru Impreza and Crosstrek only come with their 2.0L flat-4, which is fairly low on power and torque. The 2.5L is not an option on these cars. Subaru's CVTs aren't exactly exciting either, as they make it difficult to really get all the usable power and torque out of the fairly low-power 2.0L engine. If you want to go that route, opting for a Crosstrek with the new 6-speed manual wold be more enjoyable to drive and would help you coax power from the engine more easily.. The Forester's base engine is the 2.5L flat-4, comparable to the 2.5L inline-4 in the CX-5 and the same engine in the upper trims of the Mazda 3 (the base trim Mazda 3 has a 2.0L inline-4, same one as the CX-3). In general, I like the Mazda 2.5L engine better for three reasons:it has more easily accessible torque, it sounds better when revving high for max power, and it pairs with a 6-speed automatic transmission that's much better at getting torque out of a naturally-aspirated 4-cyl than Subaru's CVT. Having said that, Subaru's engines are a bit more fuel efficient (it's close though), and the flat-4 engine (also callled a Boxer engine) allows for a lower center of gravity in the Forester. Doesn't make a huge difference, though, because both Mazdas are definitely more fun to drive than the Forester 2.5i.. In terms of reliability, Mazda and Subaru are both better than average for the market, but lower than the likes of Honda, Kia, and certainly Toyota. The Subaru 2.5L flat-4 (FB25) has been in use since 2011 with no widespread problem to note. The Mazda 2.5L inline-4 (SkyActiv-G 2.5) first appeared in the CX-5 in 2013 and has similarly had no known issues. The bigger consideration for me would be the transmissions. Subaru's CVTs have been less reliable of late, with Subaru going so far as to extend the CVT warranty to 10 years on many of their models a few years after purchase to ease possible uncertainty regarding the lifespan of the transmission. Mazda's 6-speed automatic is solid, more reliable, and more fun to drive.. A Mazda 3 hatchback in Touring trim would be my recommendation for you, if it meets your practicality needs..

1606,TheCrudMan, Mazda CX-3.  Best in class.. ,Sub_Content, 29 days ago,t1_dzjiyht,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8l00uc/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
1607,IKnowNewCars," If something like the HR-V is better because the price is lower and the space is sufficient, I'd definitely look into that class (same as the Crosstrek). Between the two, the Crosstrek is the one I prefer, since the HR-V is lacking in a lot of things that make the CR-V such a great crossover.. If you try out the Crosstrek, I'd recommend the Premium trim, definitely worth the money over the base model. Opting for the manual is a great way to save money and have a more fun-to-drive crossover (the 2018 Crosstrek has a new great 6-speed manual), but the CVT is fine if you'd rather not shift for yourself. Opting for the Premium w/ CVT and optional EyeSight system comes out to $26k MSRP.. The CX-3 is another great option, one of the most fun to drive in its class. The Touring trim is a great middle-ground, and adding the Preferred Equipment package brings the MSRP to $26k.. A brand new one that I haven't gotten much experience with is the Hyundai Kona, but the reviews I've read are all very promising. The Limited and Ultimate trims have the best engine in the class, a 175 HP turbo-4, but AWD models start above $26k. An SEL model w/ optional Tech package has an MSRP of $25k and should compete against the others very well.. Test drive these and see what you think! Make sure to consider interior space, comfort, features, and driving experience, in whichever order best fits your priorities. Also remember that you should be able to knock a bit off the price of each of these at the dealership, so try and find the best available offers for each..

1625,IKnowNewCars," Take a look.  at Car &amp; Driver's review of the XC40 R-Design, which comes with the T5 powertrain and AWD. Aside from the orange carpets (which are an option I wouldn't add personally), it seems like a great, fun luxury crossover. The R-Design trim is the most fun-to-drive, with a few sportier additions to the driving experience and a good balance of features and value. It's also well priced at just over $38k MSRP, and even the option packages are fairly inexpensive (all 4 packages include popular features, so you'll have to decide which ones you want/need and how many you can afford).. The XC40 will be smaller than a Subaru Forester, and the R-Spec starts a bit more expensive than the MSRP of a top-level Forester XT Touring. The Volvo would be a bit quicker (even with the Forester XT's 250 HP turbo-4) and more fun to drive, with similar safety ratings, but lower expected reliability. And you'd have to add option packages to include driver assistance and active safety features that are standard on a Forester XT Touring. But if you test drive both and you can afford both, I think an XC40 R-Design could be a crossover you enjoy driving more on a daily basis, and to me that's definitely worth it..

However, my parents have personal emotional issues against the car so likely I will have to sell it before I head to University. For now my next one I would really like to get something that has four doors, more fuel efficient, and I can take camping. Through my searches I've kind of started to look at Subaru Foresters and Toyota Highlanders, with the all-wheel drive hybrid Toyota Highlander peaking my interest, 2005-2009 range. My father, someone fairly mechanicaly experiencedbut also dead set in his opinions axed the idea of a hybrid, with the argument that they cost a lot to repair.. The Subaru would be more ideal honestly but their gas efficiency doesn't go very high, especially because if I got one I would be determined to get it in a manual. FYI I'm definitely trying to go late 2000s model.

I've found corvettes to be 3-5k cheaper in my area but I want a little more space than a vette can offer and I think the hellcat will probably hold its value better (assuming the new mid engined vettes don't suck). On the other hand I like the way the vette drives a little more, it's not so scary in the rain like the hell cat. The other thing I don't really know is the difference in reliability.

The Honda is the most economic (fuel wise and money wise), but I hate the way it looks and the infotainment console is one of the worst and most confusing I've ever seen. There are also 2 local Honda dealerships that I'm very comfortable with for repair and service. The Mazda3 feels like a compromise. More hp than the Honda for a little fun, naturally aspirated engine so fewer components to break down, but is very loud, has rather narrow seats that make it uncomfortable, and is prone to rust. The GTI checks the most boxes, but is the most expensive and the most thirsty. It was quiet and comfortable, has a great infotainment console, and is super zippy and fun. My fears with the VW run along the lines of reliability and cost of repairs and service. I've obviously never owned a German car before and I do know that the engines of the GTI's tend to over carbonate around 50k miles.

I heard/read Lexus are quite boring vehicles when we compare it to STi or 340i, and for me I do want a vehicle where I can have some fun in and possibly sell it before my lease ends, and possibly see if I can sell it above the buyout option price at end of lease.. Curious if anybody has the performance figures, track time figures, any YouTube videos that compares these models and give an unbias opinion? I tried looking but there's not much. And quite frankly, I don't think anybody actually buys a Lexus and use it as a track or sports car, I believe people mainly use Lexus vehicles as a street/commute car to go from point a to b, hence not much reviews on the 2018 IS350 AWD..

1693,IKnowNewCars," All three of the cars you mentioned start over $40k for AWD models. This is fine, since you can surely get the price under $40k for at least some of them, but the chances of you getting one brand new with things like parking assistance and built-in navigation for that price are fairly low.. Either way, the Audi A4 Quattro would definitely be my first choice out of the ones you mentioned. It's a great balance of sport and luxury at a good price, and Audi's reliability has improved greatly over the past 5 years or so compared to their troubles in the early 2000s. It's also one of the most fuel efficient in its class, while still being one of the fastest (0-60 in 5.2 seconds). I recommend picking the manual transmission if you can, but the auto is solid too. A built-in navigation system isn't standard, but Android Auto and Apple Carplay are, so you can use your phone to show maps on the infotainment screen.. You can keep your costs low but still get a very fun sports sedan by opting for the A4 Quattro in the base Premium trim, then adding the Sport package and 18"" wheels (you should also consider adding the no-cost summer tires, since you gain a lot of traction and control during the winter by swapping in snow tires instead of all-seasons anyway). MSRP comes out to $43k before dealer discounts and incentives.. ",Sub_Content, 1 month ago,t1_dzaul8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8jbff6/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

1695,IKnowNewCars," Let's talk a bit about its competitors, then!. Alfa Romeo Giulia. This is my favorite car in its class, the driving experience is just fantastic, but reliability is so hit-and-miss that I can't recommend it as a car you might want to keep for 10 years.. Mercedes-Benz C300. Very luxurious interior, great steering feel, solid powertrain, but it wouldn't match the Audi in terms of reliability, fuel efficiency, and general sporty demeanor.. Kia Stinger. Now this one might be worth considering. The Premium trim w/ the 2.0T powertrain would come with a very spacious interior, tons of tech, and great reliability, though it wouldn't be as thrilling to drive. The GT1 is my favorite Stinger, but while it's an absolute blast to drive (0-60 in 4.4 seconds) and comes with a lot of features, it doesn't have quite the refinement (or nimble handling) of the Audi. Might be worth a look though!. Acura TLX. Getting the TLX V6 SH-AWD w/ the Technology package is a great way to get lots of features and a fairly well-rounded luxury sedan for $43k MSRP, but it's not a powerful or thrilling vehicle, and the interior definitely doesn't hit Audi levels of refinement. Plus Acura's reliability has lagged behind Honda lately, for some reason.. BMW 3-series. Still a great sports sedan, but it's not what it used to be. A 330i xDrive starts at $43k before adding any options, and it's still not as quick as an Audi A4 Quattro. If you want to test drive a 320i xDrive in Sport Plus design, you could come up with something decently affordable, nimble, and fun, if not quick or particularly luxurious.. Buick Regal GS. Based on the new Sportback body style, the Regal GS is actually fairly sporty and quick with lots of standard features at a great price. Plus Buick routinely offers massive discounts off MSRP for their vehicles. Again, it won't be as refined as the Audi, but if you want a lot of performance and features for the money from a brand name that has surpassed all other American brands by far in terms of reliability, the Buick Regal GS is worth a try.. There are tons of others too:Cadillac ATS, Genesis G70, Infiniti Q50, Jaguar XE, Lexus IS, Lincoln MKZ, Volvo S60, and even Volkswagen's upcoming Arteon sedan. But I do think the Audi's gonna be your best bet for what you're looking for. Test drive a few different options, though!.

1707,ohnoimrunningoutofsp," Some people prefer a mustang GT vs a golf R. Very opposite looks wise. Golf r more like a sleeper. Subtle. Mustang GT very in your face. Pros and cons of both obviously.. If you're shopping for an RS5 i'll assume like you said money isn't a huge concern. In that case here are some great cars in that category.. If gt350 came in auto that would be great for you, but since not..2018 mustang GT with performance pack 1 or 2 for your handling needs. OR can probably spend half of that and buy the parts yourself. Obviously I'm biased but man the 2018s 0-60 in on par with an m2,3,4 etc. 3.9 seconds in auto.. M2 M3 M4, all still great I hear. Obviously maintenance can get expensive, especially for an M, but seems to not be a huge issue.. S5/RS5 are great but I hear audi is even more unreliable than bmw. Still, I really love the look of these cars and performance/reviews are great as well. Consider RS3, i think 2018 came out, 0-60 in 3.5ish. Very nice. Probably cheaper than a new s5 or even used rs5. Handles great.. Aww I wish you liked mercedes, a c63 or cla45 would be great for you.. Maybe a 2010 ish GTR can be had at around 65-70k? Those are monsters on that track obviously.. If you've considered mustang, please consider camaro or corvette at that price range.. Camaro 2SS or if you can afford the higher up trims like 2ss 1le or zl1 those would be monsters as well. Either way, camaro is faster in a straight line and on the track over the equivalent mustang (although the 2018 caught up a fair bit). Cons are camaro is more expensive, and visibility is atrocious. Like not just oh its a little tight, it's DANGEROUS. Don't listen to those people who just say ""oh it's fine just adjust mirrors"". It's one of the worst cars visibility wise. But a stupid tight car for it's weight. It went around a track same as the m4.. Corvette - Also love the look and performance. Could get a used z06 or a new ""base"" engine.. Jaguar is sort of in this price range as well but I don't know enough about jaguar and usually they're not that good bang for buck compared to others. And if no porsche and mercedes I would say these are your best bets. Let me know if you have any more specific questions..

1708,StrapOnDingo," Hey guys! Thank you in advance for your help. I used this template from a different subreddit to get you some information. Right now I drive a Jeep Wrangler and with a 50-60 mile (mostly highway) daily commute I know that the amount I'm spending in gas is going to take a toll. I'm currently looking into getting a new car that would potentially be temporary (maybe 1- 2.5 years unless the car is worth keeping) until I can afford to move out into a place closer to where I'm going to work. Current thoughts are to find something I can drive for a year or two then sell it when I don't have a long commute and then use the Jeep. I've considered trading in the Jeep, but would only do so if the car was going to be a definite for the long term future.. Location:Orlando, Florida. Price range:If new, $15,000-$27,000.

Have considered hybrid, but leaning towards a no.. Must haves:Fuel efficiency ‚Äì I'm driving 50-60 miles a day (mostly highway) so fuel efficiency is huge for something that will be able to keep the efficiency around 70-80 mph.

1731,Richfappening," Location:  Germany. Price range:  20-35k Euro. I want to buy . used. , up to 25k kilometers. I would not mind a new one of course but I don't think that there are such cars in that price range.. Type of vehicle:  Not really sure. Maybe sport sedan?. Desired transmission:  i would like manual, but auto is also fine. Intended use:  Daily driver and at some point later in life family car. Vehicles i have already considered:  Kia Stinger i hope the price drops a bit because it has everything i want (7 years warrenty, awd or rwd, V6, a lot of space and a lot of gadgets, nice key) only the sound is kind of lacking, Hyundai i30N cheap, 5 year warrenty, great sound, manual but sadly its fwd.. Not my first vehicle. I could do minor work. , but i think i need to bring it into the shop to keep the warrenty and so on?. I couldn't do major work.. Additional Notes:  As you can see I am kind of looking for the perfect car. Kind of low price with a fair amount of power. Preferably  a manual V6 thats rwd or awd. You can also see that i am not hard set on these things because the i30 doesnt really tick a lot of these boxes.. I've also looked at the Toyota GT86. I looks great, is RWD and also reliable because its toyota. Sadly its not really spacious enough. I want to be able to transport 3-4 people + luggage.. I also know some people who drive an Seat Leon Cupra. Great car, but it would feel weird to also buy one. Also it doesn't tick a lot of the boxes :. I am not interested in an VW GTI.

1774,IKnowNewCars," The Escape is in one of the most popular car segments in American right now. There are tons of great options. In your price range, here are the ones I would test drive (all prices MSRP w/ destination fees). Ford Escape SEL AWD w/ Safe and Sound package:$32k (before incentives). Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD:$32k. Honda CR-V EX-L AWD:$32k. Hyundai Tucson Limited AWD:$32k. My personal favorite of these is the CX-5, since it's the most fun to drive and has the nicest interior (in my opinion). The best all-around might be the CR-V, which does everything pretty well, including having the biggest cargo area and best fuel economy in its class. The Tucson is notable for offering nice handling, smooth ride quality, and a nice interior with a great feature list for the price. The Escape is still worth considering too; while it is a bit expensive (before the many incentives Ford offers), and its interior space and fuel economy aren't great, it does offer a surprisingly composed ride and a peppy driving experience, along with one of the best infotainment systems on the market..

1780,scorpionMaster," Off your list, the Civic is least likely to be a money pit, and it'll be best on gas. The Mustang would likely be pretty reliable, but in your price range, you're looking at an older model with remarkably poor fuel economy. SI Civics will be hard to find in your price range.. The 350Z will kill you on insurance. You can get quotes online from Progressive and Geico.. The Golf, Saabs, and E30s are likely to have more maintenance costs than the other cars..

1785,IKnowNewCars," There are tons of used options, and I'll let other folks here give you some info on them, since it's not my expertise. As a new driver still in school, I think it makes sense to buy new if you can, since you'll get the safest vehicle possible and a warranty for better peace of mind. And luckily, there are lots of options that are safe, inexpensive, and fun to drive!. Let's focus on crossover/SUVs and mid-size SUVs. Compacts like the Impreza, even if they have great crash test ratings and the best safety equipment, will never quite reach the level of safety that bigger vehicles can reach simply because of their lower weight. But there are still so many options. Here are some examples of what you can test drive (all prices are MSRP, including delivery, not including tax, before manufacturer incentives and dealer discounts): Mazda CX-5 Sport AWD w/ i-ActivSense Package:$27k. Honda CR-V EX AWD:$29k. Mazda CX-3 Grand Touring AWD w/ Premium Package:$29k. Subaru Forester 2.5i Premium Black Edition:$29k. Toyota Rav4 XLE AWD w/ Extra Value ""Power Plus"" Package:$29k. Some tiny crossovers are about the same weight as small cars (like the Subaru Crosstrek, which is basically an Impreza hatchback on stilts with other minor changes). These ones will be safe, but not as safe as bigger options. I haven't seen any crash test data for the Hyundai Kona yet, but I can tell you that the Kona is one of the small crossovers I'm most excited about, particularly with the 1.6L turbocharged engine. I'd keep an eye out for those crash tests, but otherwise, the Kona Ultimate AWD would absolutely be on my list of cars to test drive..

1805,Stuckinwell," 3 series depends strongly on the MY. Generally, BMWs exhibit rapidly growing maintenance needs as they age but some years are worse than others. Mercedes is definitely a good place to look for nice suspension, but know the SLK lacks some of the interior room you might take for granted. Of course, a great deal will help you overlook such inconvenience, but a convertible can be a big pain point to fix. If you need more room, an E-class is a very comfortable place to spend your time.. You probably don't want a G37. I have one and I love it, but it sounds like you'd appreciate the luxury interior and suspension more than sporty handling and aftermarket scene.. It's hard to go wrong with a Lexus for luxury image. Their sedans are well known for reliability and cushy driving experience.

1813,IKnowNewCars," $10k is a solid deal for that car, strictly based on estimated value. If it was spec'd out like my SO's 2015 Forester and was in nice condition, it might go closer to $15k even at 88k miles.. But you should keep a few things in mind:22,000 miles a year is a LOT. If your sister wasn't meticulously keeping up with the maintenance schedule (including transmission service), things can start going wrong quickly. Subaru's reliability has been better than average, but not up to the level of Honda, Kia, or certainly Toyota lately. In particular, Subaru went out of their way to extend the warranty on a ton of their CVTs (including the one in your sister's 2014 Forester, unless it's a manual) to 10 years/100k miles, citing customer complaints over the reliability of the transmission. Her car only has 12k miles to go until that warranty is up, so if the CVT breaks after a year or more, you're probably on the hook for a fairly expensive repair.. Having said that, you are probably saving some money with that $10k price point, so you'll have to weigh out the pros and cons there. For example, a 2014 Toyota Rav4 AWD with fewer miles than your sister's Forester could easily go for $15k, or more with some options. Reliability would be better, but the AWD system isn't quite as capable as Subaru's, and you'd be paying $5000 extra.. Maybe just ask your sister to be real with you about maintenance, repairs, and how well she's taken care of it. If you do buy it and the warranty expires without any issues from the CVT, you can take it to a Subaru dealership and have them do a full transmission service. That's your best chance of keeping it going for the life of the rest of the car. You can take it to a shop instead of the dealership to save money, but not all shops will service Subaru CVTs, so do your research first..

1828,pm-me-ur-car-pic," The WRX isn't an unreliable vehicle per se, but it's not quite as bulletproof as a Camry. Camry is a big car though, so consider that. It's way, way bigger than an 05 Corolla. WRX is super fun to drive though and they're great in snow. Hard to go wrong with it.. If you go for a Civic, get the 1.5T. The base engine is lame.. If you want something a little nicer, look at a Lexus IS250 or IS250 AWD. They're quite reliable, but in the case it does break down it won't be quite as cheap as a Toyota to Fix.. If I was in your position I would honestly just pick up a new Golf GTI S with the 6 year warranty. It's not a sedan, but the GTI is awesome to drive and very comfortable for the price. Warranty has nothing to do with getting into accidents, it covers repairs if the car breaks down. That means any repairs in the first 6 years of ownership are covered with the VW..

If you want something a little bigger, look at the Toyota RAV-4, Honda CR-V, and Mazda CX-5, and Subaru Forester.

I like having two cars so that I can take my time with repairs on one, but it's one more car to wash/park/insure/maintain. The coupe is kind of a pain with my toddler, and even though he likes riding in the mustang, I usually just drive him around in the accord. The accord has been babied it's whole life, however, EVERYTHING besides tires, brakes, battery on the car is original-from-the-factory (suspension, axles, motor mounts, etc.). It is a great car and I know I will miss it if I sell it, but as a car enthusiast, I love driving stick.. My other option is to keep the accord, sell the mustang, and get a civic hatch (92-00) as a fun second car. I have wanted one of these for a while, and ended up getting the mustang on a whim while I was primarily searching for a civic. I'm also open to other cars I did not list above as considerations.

1859,pm-me-ur-car-pic," The TLX is a great value on the used market. Very comfortable on the freeway and super smooth. Interior is nice, better than any non-luxury car. Get the V6 if you want some power, but even the 4 cylinder is good. You can find them with lots of technology and features too. The IS is very comfortable and has great interior but the rear seat is a little tight. The IS250 is a little slow by sports car standards, but costs way less used than the IS350. The ES isn't quite as sporty as the TLX or IS, but very smooth.. I would stay away from Audi or Mercedes unless you're willing to put up with the repair bills.

1871,Maxrdt," I prefer handling in a sports car, but power for a daily, so it's kind of an even split. I would say the BRZ class is the least powerful I would want, G35/37 the most powerful.. Interior isn't a priority, but a nice addition. The Versa I currently daily isn't much on the interior, so pretty much anything is a step up. Certainly don't need luxury accoutraments though.. The MR2 is fantastic, though I can't daily that because of rust concerns. Yes there will be snow, but after a winter of nearly bald tires in upper Michigan it's not a huge concern, I get snow tires now and have never had a problem.. I'm really just vaguely looking now, wanting to add cars to look at and determine further. Will still need to do test drives and things to see what I like. Sorry if this is a bit vague lol..

Had a 2016 STI for a while - was a very rough ride for a daily and not as fast as it sounded by modern standards.

1954,parkmanw," Well, I had an ND Miata and put 23000 miles on it, 90% of which was driving just for fun, either exploring or canyons. LOVED that car. The two things it lacked was engine character and the suspension needed help above 60mph.  But, you could modify one to your heart's content with your budget. Edelbrock Supercharger, Ohlins coilovers, etc. You could drive that car everyday. I now have a 981 Boxster S with all the performance options, PASM suspension, Porsche torque vectoring, sport Chrono pack with dynamic engine mounts, etc. I STILL often miss that Miata. Don't get me wrong, the Porsche is a fantastic car, and it has what the Miata lacked, engine character and stability at speed, but the Miata was more fun on the really tight stuff.(it's also much lighter than an S2000 and has a better interior with a good sound system/navigation which I used to find all my favorite roads) I also took the Boxster S on a 3500 Mile road trip and if you ever plan on doing that, it's very, very comfortable and has lots of storage for a two seater sports car. (Same goes for Cayman if you prefer a roof, but I would get a convertible in California, Muir woods will blow your mind in a convertible). That being said, I'm also going to pick up an Exige in two weeks to fill that void for the tight canyon carving. (Keeping the Boxster S too, could never sell that car). Wouldn't get the CLA45 AMG or the E92 M3 or the Viper. The C6 Z06 will give you the biggest performance numbers, but less fun on the street compared to the lighter options.. I would also throw a Golf R in there. I drove the mk. 7 on Angeles Crest and really enjoyed it. It's not as thrilling but it's still fun and very practical if that matters at all to you..

Otherwise you'll just end up always wondering what a Lotus would be like... at least I would. It's like the quintessential driver's car, simple, lightweight, direct... Plus you almost get a blend of the other light weight options, because it revs to 8500rpm which gives you a little S2000 taste, it's mid-engined like the Porsche Cayman/Boxster, and it's lighter than a Miata! Win, win, win! The only thing it misses is practicality, which is irrelevant for you. That would be my choice! Anyhow, hope you find what you're looking for.

But I got tired of not fitting in smaller cars after the Miata, so went with a BMW E30, but it wasn't quite as fun, although a legendary car. And also a retro period where I had a 280Z, which was fun as well for some different reasons. So you might also consider the older stuff; not as capable from a performance point of view, but more fun in some other ways.. I wouldn't worry about how using a Lotus will make other cars feel.

1975,parkmanw," I think the GT4 is a pretty phenomenal car. It honestly depends on how you intend to use the car, what you personally appreciate and value most about how a car feels and functions, and how experienced of a driver you are. Based on what I've read, the GT4 will be more comfortable and more usable, but the GT3 is more raw and engaging. But power wise they're similar as far as acceleration goes.. 12.2 1/4 mile for the GT3, 12.3 1/4 mile for the GT4. Gearing may make that feel a little different in corners, but honestly I'd imagine they feel pretty similar power wise. My biggest concern with the GT4 would be the steering. I have a 981 S, and the steering is not all that communicative until you really push it. I'm sure the GT4 is better than my S, but I would drive both of them if you can before you buy! My biggest concern with the GT3 is if you intend on going on extended journeys, as from what I've read on forums and reviews, it's not very comfortable.. Do some reading on rennlist and pistonheads, people on there who've owned both share their thoughts on how they compare..

1997,CouchMountain," For the LSD, when you test drive it do a small circle. Just enough to get the tires to spin a little bit. Don't dump the clutch, just circles. It'll spin and if one wheel spins, no LSD. If both spin, then LSD.. Or you can just call Mazda with the VIN and ask if it had an LSD assuming the owner didn't swap out the LSD, which I doubt they would.. Also if you're set on a miata, they'll run for ages as long as it's in good shape. Parts aren't hard to find and they're relatively easy to work on.. Also if you're turning it into a drift car, you won't want AC anyways. Power steering, meh. I have one car w/o power steering, one with. The one without is much more responsive but harder to turn when moving slowly. IMO, it's not necessary on lightweight cars but on heavy cars you need it. Also no Power Steering generally means less components to fix and less weight.. Full drift car = LSD is a must. Engine and tranny need to be good, AC, power steering, interior, etc doesn't matter.. Daily/Drift car:AC is nice, but I've lived just fine without it on hot days. Passengers hate it though. Power steering is just preference. Test drive both if you can, see if you need it. LSD is a must.. It's pretty much based on which of those two you want. If you plan to eventually go full drift, then buy one that fits what I put in there. Keeping as a daily then go daily/drift.. Lastly, look around at others who drift miatas on forums and such. Talk to them about what's best. Go to drift events and talk to miata owners and find their opinion too..

If you‚Äôre planning on engine swapping and welding, I definitely think a rolling shell is perfect. Then you can buy an engine, build it how you like, and swap it in.

2018,honour_the_dead," I'm biased, but was shopping more or less on your requirements and got the TL SH-AWD. They're a few years old, but much better than the newer replacement TLX.. Pros:It's bigger and quieter than the A6 inside, very winter capable, fits two pairs of skis (mine are old school 207cm). I've spent more money in 5 years mounting and unmounting winter tires than I have in maintenance. The torque vectoring AWD and fresh tires will make it outhandle a GTI.. Cons:Trunk space is limited and the Tech Package is so dated I got the dealer to find me one without it. I've just used bluetooth audio from the start.. The refreshed 2012-2014 models have a 6 speed auto. Manuals are out there, but very rare. You should test drive one if you haven't. Make sure to get the revs up and roll on the throttle mid-turn to feel the torque vectoring in the rear. In the snow, it's like magic. It just goes where you point it..

2019,IKnowNewCars," The first thing to keep in mind here is that for most bad-weather situations (wet/icy/snowy winters), winter tires will be more helpful than AWD will. Folks who just need a little extra traction when accelerating from a stop will benefit from AWD over FWD, and that can be enough if you don't have to deal with a long, harsh winter, but for lots of folks, a FWD with winter tires is better than an AWD with all-season tires when it gets below freezing. I'll start with AWD options, but don't feel like you have to pay a premium for it or compromise in other ways; buying a set of steel wheels and snow tires is often cheaper and safer than AWD.. In general, a mid-size sedan or compact crossover (or bigger) can fit a rear-facing car seat behind the driver with sufficient room. The question is whether you only need to fit 2 car seats in the back, or if you might need to fit an adult or some extra stuff as well. Starting with AWD vehicles, the Legacy can certainly do it all, but it's far from my favorite family sedan (it's slow, boring to drive, and really just doesn't stand out in any way from its competitors except having standard AWD).. If you can approach the high end of your price range, I'd suggest looking for a luxury sedan! The . Audi A4.  comes with a very peppy engine and a choice of manual or automatic transmission (both are great), as well as its signature Quattro AWD system. Its crash test ratings are great, and it comes standard with front crash prevention. If I were you, I'd opt for the Premium Plus trim w/ the 252 HP engine, pick whichever transmission suits your fancy, add the Cold Weather package (MSRP comes out to $45k), then I'd add the no-cost summer tires. You'll have more fun with summer tires than all-seasons when the weather is nice, and if you swap in snow tires during winter, you'll be safer on the road.. SUVs and wagons offer tons of great options, from the safest ones like the Outback (comfortable and reliable, but not super exciting either) to the . Forester XT.  mentioned by the other dude (very quick and includes selectable drive modes to make the CVT act a little nicer). The . Audi Q5.  is definitely worth a look too, though the Premium Plus trim w/ Cold Weather package will come in at $47k MSRP, a bit more than a comparably-equipped A4.. If you decide that swapping in winter tires is a better use of your money than AWD, my pick would be the 2018 . Honda Accord. It's far more enjoyable to drive than the Legacy, even with its base 1.5T engine, but it's the upgraded 2.0T engine with 250 HP that really brings it to life. It's honestly a lot of fun for a FWD family sedan. The . most.  fun version would be the Accord Sport w/ 2.0T engine and manual transmission, which comes out to $31k and is still an IIHS Top Safety Pick. But if you want more features and a nicer interior, the EX-L trim comes w/ the 2.0T engine and 10-speed automatic transmission has pretty much everything you'd be looking for at only $33k. And an Accord with snow tires is better than nearly any AWD car with all-season tires, trust me!.

2036,IKnowNewCars," I'm a big fan of the A4 as a balance of sport and luxury. Audi's done a wonderful job with it, from the peppy engine (0-60 in 5.2 seconds is nothing to scoff at), to their Quattro AWD system, to the nimble chassis, to the well-appointed interior. The only problem in this case is that adaptive cruise requires the top-level Prestige trim, bringing the MSRP up to $51k. If you can do without it, the $45k Premium Plus trim is a great balance of pricing and features. I recommend adding the Sport Package and no-cost summer tires to either.. If Adaptive Cruise is a must, let's look at other options that offer it for cheaper. A Mercedes-Benz C300 can be had with the Driver Assistance and Multimedia packages for about $47k, and while it won't be exactly thrilling, it would be a nice mix of enjoyable driving and lots of luxury for the money. The best-driving car in its class is definitely the Alfa Romeo Giulia, and if you can put up with very questionable reliability, a Giulia Ti Sport w/ Performance Package, Driver Assist Dynamic Plus Package, 19"" wheels and summer tires would be a dream for $48k.. But your best luxury deal might actually be the brand new Kia Stinger. They've done an amazing job creating a great value as a fun, spacious luxury car, and even though it doesn't quite feel like a BMW or Audi, it comes surprisingly close. You have two options here:opt for a Stinger Premium w/ the Kia Drive Wise package for a $40k car that's very comfort, spacious, and relatively fun with a standard 255 HP turbo-4, or go for a Stinger GT1 w/ the Kia Drive Wise package for a $46k performance monster with a 365 HP twin-turbo V6 (capable of 0-60 in 4.4 seconds), an electronically-controlled suspension, all kinds of other performance upgrades, plus the features you're looking for in a car that's more spacious than any of the others you've been looking at. It's at least worth a test drive!. If you decide not to go luxury, the 2018 Accord is a great way to go. Make sure you opt for the 2.0T engine with the 10-speed auto transmission. For a FWD family sedan, it's awesome to drive, and while the top-level Touring trim is expensive at $37k w/ the bigger engine, it should offer everything you're looking for and still be a pretty fun way of driving to work for a good price..

2043,pm-me-ur-car-pic," A 2016 Honda Accord V6 seems to fit all of your requirements. It has plenty of power, leather, good trunk space, rides well, handles well, and the higher trim models have android auto and navigation. If you want a car that looks really good too, get a 2016 Accord Coupe V6.. The Accord and Accord Coupe were available in manual too but the chances of finding a 2016 manual with a V6 is pretty rare. Even if you find a manual I4, the chances of it having leather/nav/android auto are pretty low. If you can find a '16 V6 manual then go for it.. I don't know about a Focus RS in that price range, but you should definitely look at a Focus ST. A 2017+ Focus ST with SYNC3 has android auto. You should even be able to buy a new 2018 Focus ST with android auto and leather for under $25k if you can find the right deal. This is a great deal on a fun car.

Tires, ECU mods (if quality ones are avail such as my SI's Hondata), and then maybe boltons and that's it. MPG/maintenance/other running costs aren't a big deal, but insurance is as a 25&gt; male.

2050,BasementDweller_," All the Ones you are looking at are all good choices, and all would probably do quite well. If you can deal with checking your oil every time you get gas, the Honda S2000 will give you probably the best performance out of all of these. Besides that it has great aftermarket support from good companies. If you do go with this, I cannot stress enough that you do NOT want to hurt your engine. A friend of mine has an AP1, and after not checking the oil for just over 6 weeks, he spun a bearing. It could have been much worse, and since Honda isn' t selling replacements anymore, a used one will set you back about $5K..

2052,BasementDweller_," From the limited research I've done, as long as you check your oil on a very regular issue, the FA20 is insanely reliable, just like almost every other honda engine. While there were some differences between the engines put in the AP1 and AP2, I think this is consistent between them. Like I said before, If you can put up with that, the S2000 is a wonderful car both to drive, own and look at..

2053,pm-me-ur-car-pic," Elantra is a good car for your uses.. $13,626 is an okay deal on that car if that price is . after.  all taxes and fees and stuff. It's a fine ""out the door"" price. Good but not amazing. If that's the price . before.  taxes and fees, then this isn't a good deal.. Besides that $186 per month for 72 months, I would also think that they would expect some 4-figure amount of money down up front as well. If it's more than a few hundred dollars upfront then you're probably overpaying for the car.. You can find out how much you're really paying for the car by using the formula:Total Price = (down payment) + (monthly payments) x (number of months).. The APR is the interest rate, basically the fee you are being charged to borrow the money to by the car. The P stands for percentage, because you pay percentage of the loan amount as a fee every year. Because of this, the longer the loan the more you end up paying in interest.. 4.99% is an okay rate but not amazing. Maybe you could get it lower by having your parents cosign on the loan, if they're not already. If they're already cosigned, then perhaps try having them cosign on a loan with you at a reputable credit union and then using the credit union loan to buy a car. Cosigning mean both people are responsible for paying the loan, but you can still make all the loan payments yourself.. I would be extremely skeptical of anything called a ""lifetime"" warranty on a car. That's not normal in the auto industry. I would carefully look over the terms of it to see if it's actually worth anything of if they'll just use it as a selling point and then deny any claims if something breaks later. Basically I'm saying I wouldn't trust it.. Sorry if I'm making this more stressful, just trying to help. With just a little research on 2015 Elantra prices and some knowledge of auto loans you can be a much more informed buyer, which gives you far more power over the salesman. No reason to be super stressed.. ",Main_Content, 3 months ago,t1_dvjqkch,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8258fa/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

I‚Äôve found some CPO a4‚Äôs with under 20k in my price range and some a5‚Äôs with more like 30k. All ranging between 2014 and 2017 model years.

2102,IKnowNewCars," Audi's reliability has improved in a big way over the past while. I don't know any exact numbers for 2013-2015, but 2016+ has been rated very well so far by Consumer Reports. We're talking Top 5 out of all the car brands sold in the US. That's not a guarantee, and if it does need repairs it'll be more expensive than an Asian or American car to fix. But you're certainly safer than the likes of BMW.. Subaru seems like a reliable brand, but they've had their issues here and there. Right now their reliability is rated around Nissan's, which is below Toyota, Honda, and Mazda, but above most American brands and about average with German brands. A 2017 WRX with 2 owners already up for sale again seems too fishy to me, but I'm not an expert on used car buying.. A CPO Audi is a generally solid bet, in my opinion (or a used one from CarMax with their warranty). Some folks have horror stories about what Audis were like 10-15 years ago, but the number show they've improved quite a bit. Like I said, though, that's never a guarantee!.

2105,IKnowNewCars," People hold on to preconceived notions about a brand for a long time. With Audi, people still associate poor reliability and that probably won't change for a while. Kia and Hyundai make lots of folks remember their early days when quality control was poor and they were honestly not great cars, but now they make some of the best on the market. On the other side of the coin, lots of enthusiasts think of BMW first when considering a sports sedan, but many of their models don't have the same spark of excitement that their older ones did (in particular, their steering leaves something to be desired, especially next to Audi or Mercedes).. The point is, a badge by itself doesn't mean much out of context. Every car is different, and even the same make and model a few years apart can be nothing alike.

The Civic SI isn't bad, but without modification they look like just another civic imo.. You could also look into a Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart. They aren't the most common car around but it's essentially what the wrx is to the sti. It's still tuneable and looks pretty decent i think and also it fits in your price range.

2115,IKnowNewCars," If your first priority is safety, than the place to start is IIHS. Each year they have ratings for ""Top Safety Pick"" and ""Top Safety Pick+"". 2018 was a particularly difficult year, so any car with an IIHS award for this year is very safe for its class, though a 2017 award is still admirable. Here's the current list.. Style is relative, so I really can't comment on that. But we can cross reference with gas mileage a bit, and I'll include my personal recommendations for crossovers that drive the best for the money. Here's a list, starting with top recommendations and going from there: Honda CR-V. To me, this is the clear choice. It's got everything. Best gas mileage in its class, IIHS Top Safety Pick w/ Honda Sensing front crash prevention, very enjoyable driving experience with great handling, most spacious interior in its class, very comfortable, reliable, all the features she wants... the list goes on. It's been one of the best-rated SUV/crossovers for years now, so there's very little chance she'll come to regret it. Choose the EX-L trim and add navigation for $31k.. Mazda CX-5. This is actually my favorite crossover in its class, mostly because its driving experience can't be beat. It's just fun. Even the CR-V doesn't feel as sporty and refined as the CX-5. The downside is a smaller back seat and cargo area, but if your mom doesn't mind, this is definitely worth a look. The top level Grand Touring trim has the nicest interior in its class, comes with all the features your mom wants, and is an IIHS Top Safety Pick for less than $31k.. Honestly, those two are the best I can find. The Forester is awesome, but the Limited trim w/ EyeSight and navigation comes out to $33k MSRP, and it's not as fun to drive as the Honda or Mazda. The Rav4 is a very solid choice, but not only is its driving experience on the mild side, the newer models don't offer leather seats at all (Toyota's patented fake leather is called SofTex, and it's nice, but not real leather). And vehicles like the CH-R and Rogue are both fine, but don't stand out. I really think the CR-V or CX-5 will be the winner. Have her test drive both, and she can feel good about picking whichever one she likes better! No matter how many reviews she reads about either, I promise she can't go wrong..

2116,BooksBoomer, Thank you so much! I had suggested the Mazda to her before but if you can believe it there‚Äôs no Mazda dealerships in the area; the closest is 2 hrs away. She‚Äôd need to go to St Louis to buy it and to take advantage of any services provided by the dealership after she bought it (with her current Rav she got free oil changes and tune ups for like 2 or 3 years at the dealership) and god forbid if it needed warranty work they‚Äôd have to figure out how to get it up there. I told her if it‚Äôs a brand new car and she got the top of the line model they might come and get it and bring it back for her (our aunt had an Audi TT that ended up being a Lemon and the dealership was back and forth with it but then again that‚Äôs a luxury car which is probably different.). She hasn‚Äôt mentioned the CRV or any Honda I‚Äôll make sure she gives BOTH of them a hard look.

I definitely like the sportiness of the ST better. When it comes to negotiating, I have 4 ford dealerships within 50 miles i can haggle with and my company offers a discount with both makes.

2130,Floatography," tl;dr - the GT Sport is the best daily driver hatch of the ones you listed. Yes the ST and GTI have better performance, but that isn't all that makes a good daily.. I owned a GT Sport for a month before a Tesla ran a red light and totaled it (. I walked away without a scratch and didn't even wake up with a sore neck or back. ). It is the single best daily driver I have ever had.. The interior is fabulous as well. Comfortable, well finished, nice to look at, and it is fairly minimalist so it should still look good in 10 years when the warranty runs out : Not to mention the good features, excellent infotainment and good sight lines. Way more manageable blind spots than the other 2. In my short time with it I got a lot of compliments on the interior, including my insurance adjuster who was gushing about how she wanted one as her next company car after seeing mine. The exterior styling is subjective but I vastly preferred its subtle audi-esque styling to the ricey ST or lifeless GTI. The car looks MUCH better in person than in pictures. I was skeptical of its styling until I was up close with one.. The big secret to the GT Sport is that it is at peak torque from 1500rpm to 4500rpm.  so in daily driving situations it is quicker than its numbers imply since it has all its torque available at all the most common daily driving RPM. The ride quality is bizarrely good for how well it handles too. I was amazed at how it could take a rough road or speed bump for how well it takes corners. The shifter felt good to me, very non-offensive and easy to feel what gear I was in. If I can complain about anything it is that the clutch was a bit too numb but I imagine after some breaking in this would improve.. Hyundai has really good incentives right now in these as well, I think there is like a $2500 cash back or 0% APR deal going right now. Just as an FYI, if they offer your an upgraded warranty and you refuse it, they will knock the price of upgraded warranty down to nearly match the base warranty. To be honest, if you aren't going to go for one of the top 2 warranties then just get the base. The middle warranties offer little extra coverage and isn't even handled by Hyundai themselves, they are basically trying to sell you an aftermarket warranty for a new car which is kinda pointless.. I wouldn't worry about it only being on 1 lot, I was in the same situation (only one lot was carrying manuals) but in general Hyundai dealerships are very low pressure and easy to negotiate with.. Beyond everything, get the GT Sport because it is something different than the endless sea of ST and GTI that show up to every car meet. I took mine to a fairly large car meet a few days after I got it and actually received some decent attention..

2131,IKnowNewCars," The Focus ST is definitely sportier and more engaging than the Elantra GT Sport. It's actually the only choice out of the 3 you're considering that I would truly consider a ""hot hatch."" It has more power than its chassis knows what to do with, which is what makes it perfect for silly driving antics. It'll put a smile on your face. If possible, opt for one with Recaro seats (but sit in them first to make sure they're not too snug for daily use), as well as the upgraded Sync 3 infotainment system. No Focus ST is as nice as a Mazda 3 Grand Touring on the inside, but it can more than make up for it elsewhere.. The other kicker here is that you can generally get much bigger discounts on a Focus ST than a Mazda 3 or Elantra GT Sport. With Equipment Group 401A (also called ST2), the MSRP hits almost $30k, but Ford incentives bring that down close to $26k easily, plus whatever a dealership can knock off, and that's without even including your company's Ford discount. So don't let the MSRP be a deterrent here!. What the Elantra GT Sport offers is an enjoyable driving experience with decent power, a stick shift, nice standard features, and a great warranty in a $24k package. It's not a hot hatch, to be sure. But it's a very balanced car that can be both a responsible daily driver purchase and one that lets you lay down more power than a Mazda 3. Its interior is definitely nicer than a Focus ST too, with better reliability and a better warranty.. Having said all that:The Mazda 3 has the nicest interior in its price range while also retaining a sporty driving experience. It's also not a hot hatch, and its naturally-aspirated 4-cyl won't break any land speed records. It's just the feeling you get while driving it, and it's what Mazda's known for. It's sporty and fun, plain and simple. I always recommend the Grand Touring trim to folks if they can afford it, though its MSRP is $1k higher than the slightly-hotter Elantra GT Sport..

I haven't had a chance to drive the other two, but I'm definitely going to try them out. For the ST, is the ST2's 401a package that much better than the 400a package?

2135,IKnowNewCars," I'm not sure how it will affect negotiations, but if I was comparing a Focus ST with a Mazda 3 Grand Touring or Elantra GT Sport, I'd really want at least ST2/401A. Sync 3 is so much better than the original Sync system, and on top of the Recaros, you also get a nice Sony sound system, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a moonroof. But don't take my word for it, try out both and see if it makes a difference! See what prices they'll offer you with your discounts and incentives..

2136,TheGreatCause," Location:Metro Detroit, MI, USA. Price range:$10k-30k. Lease or Buy:Probably buy. New or used:Anything 2016 or newer with under 15,000 miles. Type of vehicle:Hatchback, Wagon, Crossover, Truck, SUV. Employer Requirements:American brand, not convertible, sports or luxury car, seats at least 4. My Must Haves:Trunk Space, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, Manual. Desired transmission:Manual. Intended use:Daily Driver. Vehicles you've already considered:Focus ST, Chevy Cruze Hatchback (leaning towards Diesel vs. Petrol). Is this your 1st vehicle:No. Do you need a warranty? No idea. Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:Yes. Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:No. Additional Notes: I just started my first job post-graduation and it requires a lot of travel, which is one reason I was leaning towards buying. I work for a supplier, and because of the where I live, I'm limited to American brands, plus it can't be a convertible, sports car, luxury car, and must seat at least four. Additionally, we are expected to get a new car around every five years (hence the 2016 or newer caveat), but I'm hoping to transition to another role (which may or may not have the car allowance), or even switch companies in five years.. For my job, I have equipment I have to transport. A coworker owns a Focus ST and says it's enough room especially with the rear seats folded down, so that's probably the smallest space I'm looking at. Other coworkers have unanimously suggested a small SUV, but I haven't seen one that comes in manual, and I'd rather drive something smaller/lower to the ground.. On Autotrader, the only new(ish) models I've seen sporting a stick are Jeep Wranglers, Focus STs, Fiesta STs, Chevy Cruzes, and GMC Canyon/Chevy Colorados (I4 base model). The big thing with the Canyon/Colorado is that the manual is only available in the RWD base model (it can snow a lot here), which also means it's only the extended cab, with no option for the crew cab. I guess if it comes down to it I might have to drive an automatic, but I really prefer having a clutch pedal and the experience of driving a stick. Every time I have to drive an automatic, I wish I was driving a manual.. I'll receive a car allowance - the rate is based on EPA . highway.  fuel economy divided into tiers (19 and below, 20-25, 26-30, 31+), so the better the fuel economy, the more money I receive . to a point. Getting 50 mpg highway nets me the same at getting 31 highway. The 19 and below tier is significantly less than the others. Fuel is reimbursed. , so I really don't care what grade the fuel is..

2137,IKnowNewCars," This is a pretty open submission, so I'm not entirely sure what the best way to narrow it down is. I'll just give you a few bits of helpful data: The Focus ST is a very fun option for the money. You can get big discounts on new ones these days. Get one with Recaro seats if you can, but sit in them first and make sure they're not too snug.. For a recent Colorado/Canyon, the V6 is . much.  preferred over the 4-banger. The manual transmission is its only real redeeming quality. The V6 pairs very well with the 8-speed auto, makes a huge difference in terms of usable power, allows for 4WD/crew cab, isn't a big price jump over the base engine, and is almost as fuel efficient as the smaller engine anyway.. There is something special about a Chevy Cruze manual diesel hatchback. It's the trifecta, the enthusiast dream (or meme) you can almost never find in North America. But you'll have to test drive it to see how it feels to you. The driving experience isn't exactly thrilling, though having 3 pedals and great highway mileage can make up for that.. Whether or not a Wrangler is a viable option is totally up to you. It's a ton of fun and a totally unique experience, but they're just not comfortable as daily drivers compared to most new cars/SUVs/crossovers on the road. But again, personal preference!.

I am also really liking the idea of a hatchback right now, and have been for a few years, but it seems like everyone else suggests I should get an SUV or crossover. If something like the Fusion Wagon was available stateside, I would also consider that (the Buick Regal TourX is a bit out of my price range and probably also counts as luxury)..

2139,IKnowNewCars," Wagons from American brands are basically non-existent these days. A crossover would be the next best thing, more than likely. I love hatchbacks since you have cargo flexibility without sacrificing the driving experience (lower center of gravity almost always leads to better handling), but that doesn't mean you can't find a crossover that meets your needs. For a decent-size crossover, you'll probably have to give up the manual transmission (unless you opt for a Jeep), but something like the Ford Escape or Edge might meet your needs fairly well too..

I came across Nissan Rogue SV and CX5 but since I don‚Äôt know anything about cars and hp.

I believe the 2.0L was the only option in the sport model until 2016, and all 2013 models have that 155hp 2.0L engine..

2185,ForzaTunes, No the car is not all to slow to get on a highway or something. A Crosstrek would have bad issues with a godam 10 to 11 second 0 to 60. The touring is slightly more luxurious and is slightly faster. The cx5 has decently agile suspension as Mazda never makes there cars boring and always a lil sporty it's just there thing which is nice.

2210,IKnowNewCars," The biggest consideration here is how big you actually want to go. A mid-size luxury crossover might be in your budget and would offer a ton of room, but if you can go one size smaller, you'll get more features and maybe a nicer driving experience for the same money.. The Audi Q7 is my favorite mid-size luxury crossover right now. On top of being comfortable and roomy, it actually has an agile, sporty driving feel, which makes it pretty unique next to its competitors. The Porsche Cayenne does a nice job of this as well, but it starts $10k higher. Ideally, you should opt for the 3.0T engine with the Q7 (the 2.0T isn't quick to move a vehicle this heavy), and if you add the Navigation Plus package to the base trim, the pricing comes out to $60k. For just $1k more, though, the Premium Plus trim includes navigation but also adds a really nice sound system and blind spot monitoring, so that would be my suggestion. The Q7 is spacious, and it has a small third row that you can fold up when you need it and fold down when you don't.. Some competitors worth checking out include the Volvo XC90 (Inscription T6 trim costs $60k and has a drop-dead gorgeous interior), the Acura MDX (an AWD model with Technology package is only $51k, or add the Advance package to totally deck it out for $57k), or the BMW X5 (if you like how your current BMW drives, this SUV starts at $60k).. If you decide you can go smaller, the Audi Q5 is a good place to start. Very nice balance of luxury and sporty character. Jump right to the top-level Prestige trim for a comfortable, decked-out crossover at $52k.. One more option:If you want a mid-size option that's less expensive than the luxury ones but is still nice and comfortable, check out the Mazda CX-9 Signature. The top-level Signature trim includes every option from the previous trims and adds some really nice interior appointments, like gorgeous Nappa leather seats. Like the Q7, it has a third row that you can fold down when you'd rather have lots of cargo space. The best part is that it tops out at only $45k..

2233,AUSMEL351," In the price range you're looking at, you're probably going to find issues with the cars. But I'm sure you're aware of it. Also rust is going to be an issue, seeing as you're in the GTA, as well as the E-Test (should you need to do one).. Have you thought about a Minivan? I know they're (often) FWD but they're cheap and they have good storage room. Or the old full-size passenger vans (Econoline etc.) would be a perfect fit as well for a long trip (so long as you don't mind the size).. I think a van/SUV would suit your purpose more than a truck would. A trip across Canada requires a bit of luggage, and it's easier to fit luggage and stuff (and also retrieve it) in a van/SUV than a truck.. Something such as the full-size GM SUVs (Tahoe/Yukon/Suburban) would probably suit your needs well. Maybe the ChryCo Minivans as well.. If you're still set on a truck, then something like the F-150, Silverado would work. The Tacoma has a stout engine but they have frame rot issues..

2256,IKnowNewCars," The Atlas is definitely my recommendation between the two of them. Toyota's reliability can't be beat, but VW's new 6 year/72k mile bumper-to-bumper is a nice gesture, and you get a car that's much more enjoyable to drive. VW's made a well-rounded three-row crossover with the Atlas. To get all the features you want, you'll need to jump all the way to the V6 SEL trim, then add the 2nd row captain's chairs, which brings the MSRP to just over $42k. There's a good chance you can bring that price down to $40k or below, though, considering how much wiggle room VW has been giving at their dealerships. If you can give up the sunroof and adaptive cruise, the SE w/ Tech trim would come in at $39k.. The current Highlander model is spacious, comfortable, and will do everything you want it to do, but it just lacks the driving character of many others on the market today. Same goes for the Honda Pilot. They're both great as alternatives to minivans, but there are simply more compelling options out there..

2257,ConfusedKayak," Have you driven the Atlas? Not trying to discount you, but comparing to my Father's 2015 highlander, the Atlas was terrible to drive. So much body roll, and just really lacking in power delivery. I was really dissappinted, cause on paper, it seems like an awesome car. ",Sub_Content, 3 months ago,t1_dut1vzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7ylyo0/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
2258,IKnowNewCars," Yep, I try to test drive new and redesigned models as they roll out. This does mean I haven't driven a Highlander in a while, though. Let me clarify what I mean when I say ""enjoyable to drive"" or ""driving character."" Sure, the Atlas is imperfect. Its powertrain is slow despite its solid HP rating, and the transmission needs some work. But that doesn't make it less enjoyable to drive. The steering, braking, and chassis tuning all feel great for such a large vehicle, and even if there's some body roll, cornering in the Atlas actually puts a smile on my face. VW just has a way of doing that with their vehicles (sometimes, not all the time).. The current-gen Highlander simply feels bland to me, as far as the driving experience goes. The steering feels numb, braking leaves a lot to be desired, and even if it feels surprisingly agile for its size, it just feels more like a people-moving box to me (a comfortable, reliable one at that), as opposed to a vehicle I can really enjoy driving. Having fun while driving a car isn't always about numbers or pure capability. You need to really be engaged with the driving experience. Now others may disagree with me, but unless reliability is someone's only concern when buying a three-row crossover, I'm not gonna give the Highlander a high recommendation until a redesign brings about a little less blandness in the driving experience. In fact, that's how I feel about a lot of Toyota's vehicles. They finally made improvements to the Camry, and you'll notice I've begun recommending them for 2018 because I can smile more when driving one now..

2260,IKnowNewCars," Fair enough as well! I do wonder how much better it would feel if VW put a really responsive transmission in there, one that wouldn't hesitate to find the power band when you press down on the gas at 60 MPH. That could also improve its 0-60 time without even looking at engine tuning.. The 8-speed auto in the Audi Q7 (also made by VW group) is fantastic in pretty much every way. The base 2.0T engine in the Q7 has less HP than the V6 in the Atlas, and the Q7 weighs more, but it still runs 0-60 in 7.0 seconds, as opposed to the 7.9 second run for the Atlas. I have to believe the transmission is a big part of that.. ",Sub_Content, 3 months ago,t1_dut1vzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7ylyo0/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

2263,IKnowNewCars," To add a bit more context to what the other dude said, the RDX is actually far more similar to the Honda CR-V than the Honda Pilot. They're built on the same (or similar) platforms, they're about the same size, and both have 2 rows. The Pilot has 3 rows and is much more similar to the Acura MDX. I'm a fan of the MDX, but to me, the RDX just doesn't have the enjoyable driving dynamics I've found in the CR-V. It might have some extra tech features and luxury that appeals to you, but rather than pay for an RDX, I'd just test drive a CR-V in Touring trim.. The Outback is a solid vehicle that does exactly what it advertises:it offers safety, comfort, lots of cargo space, and features that make it great in bad weather and for some off-roading (increased ride height, symmetrical AWD, and a rugged chassis). What it doesn't have is a great powertrain or a particularly exciting driving experience. If you test drive it and like it, then by all means go for it! It's a responsible, reliable vehicle.. At the vehicle size and price ranges you're looking at, it doesn't make sense to pick a luxury badge. There are plenty of options that offer a lot of comfort and features for the money. Check some of these out: Volkswagen Golf Alltrack..  The Outback's only direct competitor is this awesome car from VW, which is essentially a Golf hatchback that's been stretched into a wagon, raised up like a crossover, and given standard AWD and rugged body cladding. It can do nearly everything the Outback can do, but it's also much more enjoyable to drive. The engine and transmission are both awesome and its driving dynamics are nearly as great as the Golf. The top-level SEL trim comes with adaptive cruise, active safety features (it was an IIHS Top Safety Pick in 2017 and is pending 2018 testing with improved LED headlights), a really nice infotainment system including navigation, premium audio, all the good stuff. MSRP comes out to $36k, though I'm not sure about lease deals.. Buick Regal TourX..  Buick's 2018 redesign borrowed different chassis and engine configs from the European brand Opel, and all of them are pretty great. The TourX is their wagon, which is lifted and made more rugged to compete with, you guessed it, the Outback. If you want something more luxurious than the Outback, this might be the best way to get it. Opt for the top-level Essence trim, then add the Driver Confidence II package to get adaptive cruise and active safety features. MSRP comes out to about $39k, but Buick's known for giving big discounts, and that may extend to their lease deals. IIHS safety ratings aren't in yet, but Buick has done very well in recent years.. Mazda CX-5..  If you want the most for your money and can put up with slightly less interior space compared to the others mentioned here, Mazda is the way to go. Their CX-5 is one of the most enjoyable crossovers to drive, and the interior of the top trim level is gorgeous for the price. Deck out a 2018 model in Grand Touring trim and the optional Premium package. MSRP comes out to only $33k, but you get an IIHS Top Safety Pick for 2018, adaptive cruise and other driver assist features, Bose sound system, a really cool active driving display (HUD), and one of the best crossover interiors for under $35k with gorgeous leather seats. It's at least worth calling up a dealership and seeing what their lease deals are like..

I've seen a lot of YT reviews stating that the Pilot is miles better for the $ and the Acura is basically pointless. I'm not sure how lease figures are, but it could be cheaper than the Acura and might be worth a look at!. Between the OB and RDX, that's your call. If you want to save the money and go with the Subaru, go for it. But if you like the RDX more and want a more ""luxury"" oriented vehicle, then just splurge on the Acura. If it were me, I'd go for the Acura just for reliability (even though it's a lease, I really wouldn't want to deal with Subaru's poor reliability and having to possibly go back and forth to the dealer frequently).

Can't decide if i should buy something along the lines of a new Civic (or used BMW 3 series/2 series since the price isn't far off) and use that for a daily or buy a cheaper beater car around 10k, wait a little longer and buy a Model 3 when production ramps up. I've cancelled out buying a BMW 2016 M3/2018 Mustang GT as i dont want to put 300 miles a week on these cars. I don't need much space. Just cant make up my mind on what route to go with.

The Civic's been kind of crap since their transition to double wishbones in 2001, but the 8th gen Si had some magic.

2289,Xaendeau," Used Mustang Ecoboost?  I would get the transmission fluid and engine oil changed as soon as you get it, but I think they are good.Avoid the 6 cylinder...uses old engine tech.  Poor power and fuel economy.. The mustang 4 cylinder 2/3 turbo however gets good fuel economy...and the 2.3 L motor is good with the manual or automatic (but I always advocate for stick).. I would avoid the dodges as their economy is...eh, not that great; power sucks, older engine tech.  Infamous FCA reliability (or lack thereof).. The 4 cylinder Camaros aren't as ""good"" in my option as teh 4 cylinder mustang. 30 less horsepower and only 1 mpg better fuel economy.  6 cylinder camaro has a tad more power, but gets poorer fuel economy.  It is also hard to see out the back for those guys...they don't have blind-spots, they have blind-zones.. The Lancer evo, and Subaru WRXs are great...but they are higher maintenance with more things to break, and they are catering to a different car buyer, more extreme and tolerant to broken things.  The insurance on these two is downright murder.. BRZ will probably feel a bit underpowered in the hills, but that is the best handing car out of the group.  Back seats are, however, useless unless you have legless children.  Great track car though, but they really SUCK with automatics.  This is a manual only car..

2291,thecavebreathes," I'm going to make an argument for the V6, it sounds the best, is proven to be reliable, and makes comparable power to the Ecoboost.. I'm going to bet that long term reliability will be better as well since the Ecoboost has the complexity of a turbo engine, and is a new design. Since you are looking for a used one, the 6 speed auto in the mustangs isn't that great.. As well, the FCA cars are on the LX platform, which again, are proven architectures that date back to 2006. FCA's Hemi cars are fine, especially the 300/Charger/Challenger. They also have the ZF 8 speed gearbox that the germans use - the fastest shifts and paddle response you'll find that isn't a dual clutch.. The FRS/BRZ on paper are slower with the automatics since they don't have launch control, but the response to paddle is fantastic..

Get the transmission looked at by an independent mechanic...and then get the tranny fluid flushed as soon as purchased.. Some people expect Toyota reliability, just change the oil, and 100% forget they need to have the transmissions serviced too..

2344,IKnowNewCars," It sounds like you basically want the fanciest two-row mid-size SUV/crossover available in your price range, as long as it's reliable. Range Rovers are lovely, but they aren't reliable. Anyone who's owned a Range Rover for a while can tell you that.. So my suggestion would actually be an Audi Q7. Audi's reliability has been rated higher and higher as time's gone on, and in its higher trim levels, the Q7 can provide everything that your dad could want. The Q7 does have a third row, but if you keep it folded down, you'll never notice it's there, and it certainly doesn't compromise on the engine, transmission, comfort, features, or general build quality. It's a wonderful crossover. It feels higher up than a normal two-row crossover, but not as much as a Range Rover might, so that's the trade off.. Go for the 2018 Q7 in Prestige trim (the nicest one), which comes with the supercharged V6 engine standard (I know you don't need performance, but you want an engine that makes it easy for your dad to step on the pedal and get instant response, able to move a big vehicle without any problems). Then add the Adaptive Chassis package (incredibly comfortable and capable air suspension) and Driver Assistance package (adaptive cruise, lane keeping, automated braking, etc). This brings the MSRP to $73k. If your dad really wants the most comfort out of the car, add the Luxury package, which includes individual contour seats which are heated, cooled, . and.  have massage functionality, upholstered with gorgeous Valcona leather, plus a leather dashboard and Alcantara headliner. This brings the MSRP to $78k, and it's worth every penny, in my opinion.. ",Sub_Content, 3 months ago,t1_duqgh0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7ylyo0/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

2368,Xaendeau," Golf-R or a Civic Type-R would both be hella fun to drive, and make good DD.  GTIs are a little underwhelming.. The new ND Miatas are great!!  Better than the BRZ/86 by all performance metrics IMO.  The first year had a few weird tranny issues in a very small subset of the miatas.  Get a second year model just cause.  Slightly less practical DD.. Can wring out that ND and have SO MUCH more fun than both the ""-R"" cars.  They just go from fun to felony very quickly.  You could get a gently used Club (limited slip diff) Miata from 2017 for way under budget.. I would also suggest driving a manual Porsche before purchasing any of these as well.

2386,IKnowNewCars," I agree with the other poster here, a new Accord or Camry will be your best bet for safety. The Camry's reliability has always been great, and since the 2018 redesign, it's been much more enjoyable to drive than previous Camry models.. Test drive a 2018 Camry XSE. The leather seats and other interior appointments are nice, lots of standard features (including adaptive cruise, automated braking, etc), the engine is very fuel efficient and reliable, the sporty suspension that's standard on the SE and XSE models is pretty responsive, it's an IIHS Top Safety Pick for 2018, and the MSRP comes in under $30k..

2388,IKnowNewCars," I know the feeling! If I were you, I'd also check out the 2018 Honda Accord EX-L 2.0T. The turbo-4 powertrains are new to the Accord, but the 2.0L one is the same one they've been using for a few years now in the Civic Type R in Europe (it just came to North America last year but it's been around for a couple years elsewhere), and they've had lots of success with it tuned to 300+ HP. I can't imagine we'll run into many troubles with it tuned to 250 HP in the Accord. It comes in under $33k and should perform similarly to the Camry V6. Might be just what you're looking for!. But I do have one more option worth mentioning:The Chevy Malibu. Yes, it used to be what you'd expect to drive if you wanted a family sedan from an airport car rental agency. But the 2016 redesign improved the car quite a bit. It might not be quite as fun as an Accord 2.0T or a Camry V6, but it comes close, and you get a lot for your money. Check out the 2018 Malibu Premier, which comes with the 2.0T engine and 9-speed auto transmission. It comes with lots of features, along with nice perforated leather seats. If you add the Driver Confidence package (either the cheaper one or the more expensive Level II package), it becomes an IIHS Top Safety Pick with lots of active safety and driving assist features. The MSRP for that comes out to $33k, but Chevy is offering at least $3000 in incentives for it, bringing the price down to $30k, and you can probably knock even more off at a dealership. That could make it an excellent deal compared to a Civic or Accord that's comparably equipped (with a 250+ HP engine, that is), and the money you save might make up for any additional repair costs you'll encounter once the Chevy passes the 100k mile mark (they've improved, but it's still an American car). I do recommend the Malibu, though, it's definitely one of the better mid-size sedans on the market..

2389,thecavebreathes," The new Accords/Camrys will have more up to date safety technology and crash test results than the GS and the Genesis.. They will also have adaptive cruise, pre collision braking, and lane keep assist that will keep them safe.. The GS will likely be the most reliable since the platform has been proven, followed by the Camry since its refresh engine and platform have already appeared in other Toyota vehicles..

I would avoid the 03's, they had some issues with drive by wire and the body trim was not body colored. 04 V8 from my research has the lease potential issues. 05 the V8 was refreshed with more power, however it got the secondary air injection/pump system that can fail and is expensive to fix. There is a bypass that you can do before it fails and I would recommend it. 06-09 was the upgraded body style. The 4Runner forums are excellent and well populated.

Vehicles you've already considered:Mini Countryman All-4, BRZ, Golf GTI, WRX hatch(?). Is this your 1st vehicle:1st purchase by me solely. Do you need a Warranty:Not necessarily. Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:Yes. Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:Suspension yes otherwise no. Additional Notes:I'm going to be getting a car of my own in the next 2 or 3 years (college upperclassman) and I decided to start searching a little early (can't help myself). Wanted a 4x4 pickup (Tacoma) or a Wrangler but they're out of price range and fuel economy is an issue since I drive a lot. Also considered a WRX but the STi's are out of price range at least for the newer ones and I just don't like the regular WRX's. I do work at Carvana so there's a high chance I'll be getting a car from there if that helps anyone's advice at all. Thank you in advance..

Something that can handle a Michigan winter with some elegance (won't be DDed in winter though).. Desired transmission:  Manual 100%.

2479,VoiceInside," I can't fking decide. I went from wanting a wrx to a GTI to a GLI, now I'm on the stinger hype. But, I could only afford the base model of that, would it still be worth it or might as well just stick with the GLI(my current top option) I love the idea of a sporty rwd sedan, especially with the fastback style, but just so leery about getting a kia. And all the hype seems to fall solely on the GT trim, at which point if I was ready to spend that much I'd just go right for a BMW or Audi.. Come to mention it, I've seen used 2014 and newer A4's around for about $21k to $24k with about 20k-25k miles, and that's tempting to over the GLI even to get used, except they don't ever have the dsg transmission, and I'm again leery that it'll wind up costing me a ton in extra maintenance. Otherwise a A3 lease is only $30 more than the stinger a month anyway.. ",Main_Content, 6 months ago,t1_drdbfis,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7j1kjr/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
2480,IKnowNewCars," I'm guessing you like the GLI over the GTI simply for the body style, which is all down to personal preference. Though for me, there's no substitute for the GTI. A 2018 GTI in SE trim will be about the same price as a GLI and will include a more flexible interior, sportier chassis, more power, a limited-slip differential, and bigger brakes, among other things. The Jetta's getting a big redesign for 2019, so it may be worth seeing what that brings to the GLI.. The Stinger is a great option for the price, but I can understand being wary of it. I will say that Kia's reliability has been rated higher than most other brands in the world over the past few years, and the design of this new chassis and suspension should help it hold its own against even the great German brands. If you wanna go the RWD route, give it a test drive and see what you think. I don't think the base model will disappoint you, to be honest.. An A3 Quattro would basically be an AWD luxury sedan version of a GTI, with the same suspension, powertrain, and performance upgrades. So it's worth considering, but remember that the GTI is still very mechanically similar for less money..

2531,Inflame," West side gets hit with heavy amounts of snow from the lake effect of lake Michigan. I highly recommend an AWD vehicle and snow tires, snow tires are a MUST for any vehicle you purchase to be safe on the roads. Between $8,000-$11,000 you can a wide range of vehicles within your criteria, it really depends on what your thoughts are on for maintenance. A BMW 330xi or the sorts would be great as you get the AWD for winter and sportiness for the summer (West Side Michigan Summers are AMAZING!). It's non-turbo so you don't have to deal with high maintenance costs and the 330 engines are fantastically reliable. A subaru would be idea for versatility, low costs, cheaper insurance, etc. Jump on craigslist and take a look!.

Here are some great new cars close to $21k if you're interested: Honda Civic (Hatchback LX, Sedan LX or EX). Mazda 3 (4-door Touring, 5-door Sport). Hyundai Elantra GT. Honda Fit (EX or EX-L). 2018 Kia Rio (5-door EX). Ford Fiesta (Hatch Titanium). Or, closer to the $16k range: Toyota Yaris iA (Sedan). 2018 Hyundai Accent (SE or SEL). 2018 Kia Rio (5-door LX or S). Ford Fiesta (Hatch S or SE). Chevrolet Spark (LS or 1LT). If you wanna go cheaper than that, there are tons of used and CPO options that other folks here can share with you.

I was just going to go get another one, the dealer had several, but then I actually looked at the crash test ratings, and didn't like what I saw. I am not totally against getting another Note (considering the car kept me pretty safe in the accident), but I'm looking at other cars in the same price range just to see if there is something I like better. I'd prefer something 2011 or newer, and I need something that's going to last me a few years. Also, I'd prefer an import, and there is not enough money in the world to get me to drive another Ford.

2565,CTR_Challenger," As much as I like the Grand Cherokee and Durango, the reliability is just crap. My Uncle has a 2015 Ram 1500 and its never left the shop since he bought it. If I were you I'd look at something a bit more reliable.. What I would recommend for vehicles in that price and size range would be:Acura RDX, Chevrolet Traverse, Chevrolet Equinox, Mazda CX-9, or Buick Envision.. Now, the Acura RDX has to be at the top of my recommendations simply because I know a relative who has one and I drive it quite frequently. Its reliable, good build quality, quick V6 engine, descent mpg (due to cylinder deactivation), and has a roomy, spacious interior. You can pick up a fully loaded Advance Package AWD for $44k. I would recommend the AWD model simply because it adds to the driving experience as it utilizes Acura's Intelligent AWD which has rear power bias under heavy acceleration. The 3.6L VTEC V6 makes 289-horsepower and gets 19 City 27 Highway with AWD. You won't regret Acura reliability or maintenance either as there is very little that will need to be done.. Now with the Chevys. I am a huge fan of new Chevys. The build quality is top notch and always receives JD Power Initial Quality Awards. The Traverse is massive. Its longer than a Tahoe, and is very spacious. The new '18 Traverse is newly redesigned and takes on some looks from the Tahoe as well as loosing the minivan-ish looks. The interior is well appointed and the most spacious out of any vehicle I have recommended. You can pick up a FWD LT Leather, which is well-equipped with many safety features, for $42k. The new Traverse features an updated 3.6L V6 that makes 310-horsepower and is paired to a 9-Speed Auto. The new Traverse also gets respectable mpg for the size getting 18 City 27 Highway. The Traverse is roughly the same size as the Explorer and Durango as you describe some interest in, but you will find all around better quality in the Chevy. The Durango won't leave the shop and Ford has glitchy touchscreen units and unreliable turbocharged engines (usually ranks lowest on JD Power reliability rankings).. The Equinox is also a great choice, and I would highly recommend that you get the Diesel that is offered. Car and Driver just reported getting 43 mpg and it having over 600+ mile range. Now the diesel is not powerful by any means as it has a 9+ second 0-60 time, but if you're generally using it as a commuter than it should be just fine. It also offers a weak 1.5L Turbo 4-Cylinder and a more powerful 2.0L Turbo 4-Cylinder. If it were me, I wouldn't consider the 1.5L. Car and Driver reported the diesel having adequate power for daily driving on highways and whatnot. The Equinox is a lot smaller in size compared to the Traverse as the latest refresh has actually shrunk it to be quite a bit smaller than the outgoing Equinox. It does have a fresh-modern look and typical well-appointed GM interior, similar to the Traverse.. The Buick Envision is on the same platform as the Equinox and is just a fancier Equinox. It features a standard 2.5L 4-Cylinder engine and the 2.0L Turbo. I had the chance to test drive the 2.0L and found it to have more than enough power and great drive. The Envision is an import from China as it was first introduced in the Chinese market. You can pick up an Envision AWD Premium 2.0L for $43k which is well equipped with all the latest and greatest features.. Now finally, the Mazda CX-9 is another great option. You will be surprised with this one. Mazda's are well-known (even their SUVs) to have sportier drives and good fuel efficiency. The CX-9 features the new 2.5L Turbo 4-Cylinder which makes 250-horsepower and a whopping 310-lb-ft of torque. The CX-9 also features one of the new Mazda features called G-Vectoring technology which offers more precise steering that creates a more engaging driving experience. The CX-9 still manages to pull out 20 City 26 Highway with AWD. The one I would recommend is the AWD Grand Touring as it has leather, Bose Centerpoint Surround, Navigation, Front/Rear Parking sensors, Heated Front/Rear Seats + Steering Wheel, Sunroof, and much more. Another misconception with Mazdas is there reliability. I have a 2012 Mazda3 with 47k miles and nothing wrong at all so far. Just basic oil changes. Mazdas generally don't start having things go wrong until 100k miles (which is normal for most cars).  The new CX-9 also features Mazda‚Äôs great attempt to go more up-market with high quality dashes and BMW-like center stack. You wont regret taking a look at this.. I know I threw a lot of options out at you, but I highly recommend that you take a look at all these vehicles. I hope this helped!.

2568,DeliversKarma," I'm going to start with Additional Notes so you guys will have an idea of my current situation: I am an idiot who back in 2012 bought a brand new Hyundai Genesis 3.8 6-speed coupe, even though I live in upstate New York and entirely understand the godawful winters. In 2012 through September, I used to drive 8 miles to work (I'm a psych nurse working overnights at a hospital), so on the worst weather/snowy/icy nights, I'd catch a ride with a co-worker with a meaty Ford Explorer.  In September however, I took a new position at a different hospital, which is 53 miles away. So now I am driving over 100 miles each day to work along the I-81 corridor.. So yeah, I-81 between Binghamton and Syracuse is pretty brutal:Lake effect snow, blowing, just terribad... and I have been trying to do it in a sports car (without its snow tires, not that they help much anyways!). I decided to start looking into getting a 2nd car for winter travel, and I wanted an SUV (4WD or AWD), probably a smaller SUV with an automatic transmission because I also have a 16-year old son who needs to learn how to drive, and I don't want to even attempt to teach him on my Genesis, especially in this weather.. I've been browsing Craigslist, Facebook, other online car forums, etc. and I guess I've come to the conclusion that if I buy from a dealer, I may get a more guaranteed vehicle, but at a higher price than say if I buy one from a private party. Of course at $5000, I'm going to be in older vehicles with more mileage, and so I'm not sure what matters the most - if it's less miles or what.... I have zero skills in car maintenance, and I am not known to take very good care of my cars as it is. I work night shift and sleep during the day, so reliability is a big part for my transportation, and I don't want to spend $5000 only to get a PoS that I have to get to the shop during the day when I am supposed to be sleeping in order to go back to work at 11pm that night.. Soooo - I have turned to my Reddit friends for advice, suggestions, recommendations, including if you are in my general area +/- 3 hours or so from Binghamton, NY and you happen to have a car that suits my needs, let me know specifically :. Location:Upstate New York. Price range:Max around $5000. Lease or Buy:Buy. New or used:Used. Type of vehicle:SUV. Must haves:AWD or 4WD. Desired transmission:Sadly, this one has to be an automatic. Intended use:Highway Driving about 500 miles a week in the winter weather of upstate New York. Vehicles you've already considered:I like the looks of the Nissan Rogue and Murano, Jeep Liberty &amp; Patriot, Ford Edge, Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, etc. I'm not a big fan of Escapes, Trailblazers, Dodge/Pontiac and no thank you to any white colored vehicle (Yes, I am getting nit-picky now, I know - SORRY :.

2589,IKnowNewCars," If a Miata meets your needs (remember, it's only got 2 seats, a small trunk, and almost no other cargo space), and if you test drive it and like it, go for it. Honestly one of the best affordable sports cars in the world. Others to consider include the Fiat 124 Spider Abarth, Toyota 86, and Subaru BRZ.. If you're looking at Minis, chances are you're probably looking for that nimble, go-kart-like handling that's signature to a Mini. A Mini Cooper S 2-door hardtop would certainly fit the bill. But there are more well-rounded sport compacts on the market to consider as well, like the GTI, one of the few that's offered with a really good automatic transmission. The Hyundai Elantra GT Sport is also worth a look.. ",Sub_Content, 6 months ago,t1_dr953yc,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7j1kjr/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

2591,IKnowNewCars," Between those two I'd pick the Fit in a heartbeat. The Prius C is fuel efficient and affordable, but that's absolutely the only thing going for it. It's based on the Yaris hatchback, which already has a rather cheaply built chassis, then adds a powertrain that's weaker than the original Prius, and steering and handling that are just abysmal. It's not spacious or comfortable, and if you wanna maximize your MPG, you have to drive it with a careful foot on the gas, making it an absolute chore to drive.. The Fit, on the other hand, is great. Its engine is both fun and fuel efficient, the interior is spacious for its size and flexible, and it's comfortable and fairly feature-filled for the money.. Other solid options in this price range are the Kia Rio hatchback (especially the new 2018 one) and the Toyota Yaris iA sedan (or the old Scion iA sedan, but not the Yaris hatchback)..

2606,AutoModerator," Is insurance the only reason you're trading or are you also trying to reduce payments?  Do you owe on the car and are you upside down?  At your age insurance is going to cost regardless.  Have you shopped around with different insurance companies to see what's out there?  And have you called for a quote on any vehicles you're looking at to see if it's even going to be cheaper?. It's unfortunately hard to suggest a car based on insurance rates since everyone is different, and location/age/driving history play a big part into your rates.   Going 2 door, 2 seats, and in any car that young people like to drive is going to raise insurance due to the types of people buying them.  I highly doubt an insurance rate for an S2000 would be lower for you than a BRZ by a long shot..

2609,Willscoso," ~2011 4Runner w/ ~60,000mi could be had at the high end of your budget, but I think it might be just a bit too much SUV for you. Or maybe you'd like that. It is a really capable truck and will hold its value very well, especially considering you may end up putting so few miles on it.. I'd also consider a Toyota Rav4 or a Honda CRV from about 2013ish for a slightly cheaper/smaller car (cant be had with a third row). Can be had with everything you'd ever need, but some don't like the look. I can get that. The rear storage area of the three cars is actually pretty similar, surprisingly. More than enough for a woofer.. If you would like a more comfortable/stylish car I'd go for a 2013ish Acura MDX. Usually comes standard with heated leather seats..

Type of vehicle. :A combination of a sport(y)s car sedan/hatchback/crossover/hasLuxury. Mostly looking at sedans/hatchbacks/sporty wagons/maybe crossovers?. Must haves.  (from most to least important):4 doors &amp; 4 seats, enough power (200+ hp/torque), fun driving, reliability, standard android auto &amp; good audio, car beeps when I lock it and doesnt honk =). (I THINK I would like to have? in no particular order): (I) higher ground clearance? - I go on dirt roads camping sometimes. I don't think I'd ever take my car really offroading though; but if I don't really need clearance for off roading a little then I guess I can skip this. I could always rent a Jeep if I actually want to go off roading.. (II) AWD - thought it might help with (I). Also I keep reading that you never want a performance vehicle that is FWD, but I think that's really not true anymore. Also I thought it would be good for traction in case I move to an icier climate, but I hear that its better to just get snow tires regardless of your drivetrain.. (III) overall interior comfort.

(V) the more trunk space the better. Desired transmission. :I can't drive manual, but I'm willing to learn if its better in the long run. I enjoy driving so if driving manual is better. Basically, whichever one y'all think would be better for my driving personality. Intended use. :Daily driver/family car.

Detailed random notes:I've actually wanted the WRX since I was in high school in like 2011; now that I have a career job, I still pretty much want the WRX - but at the same time I've given notice to practicality, refinement, and cost efficiency - the WRX resale value is ridiculous, so if I were to buy it used I might as well buy it new (espically since WRX drivers aren't the most 'keep vehicle stock' safer driver kind of owners as it is); then, I could get a used GTI for almost half the price of a new WRX. The GTI also has all the refinements that the WRX doesn't have, but the GTI doesn't have as much exterior sex appeal as the WRX (GTI doesn't look bad though!). Also, I refuse to buy a WRX in a CVT, and because I can't drive manual thats also kind of holding me back. WRX PROS:AWD, sex appeal, reliablity, fun, car i've wanted forever WRX CONS:cant drive manual, new is expensive, plain interior, no android auto stock, loud cabin with bumpy ride?, i dont actually need AWD GTI - literally the opposite of the WRX PROS - will get in DSG auto, can get used, refined interior, stock android auto for 2016+ CONS - FWD (doesn't really matter though), more normal and less sex appeal, unreliable?, not as fun I've been cross shopping other potential hot hatches like the hyundai elantra GT sport, and the veloster N thats coming out later; I have an unfair bias AGAINST american hot hatches (ford fiesta and focus ST) because I have some sort of bias that they aren't very reliable, and lack the refinement that of the GTI (which I also think isn't that reliable). Please talk me out of this bias if it is actually unreasonable. I also kind of (but not really) cross shoped used luxury sedans like the IS250, and higher ground clearance vehicles.

2629,211logos," I've got a GTI and love it. I think your money will go farther with it, so if you like to mess with aftermarket stuff, track days, and so on, maybe that's a factor. It scoots, and the DSG is the bomb. I moved to that from a manual (on numerous vehicles from trucks to sports cars) and it's fantastic. Super sporty when you want, practical when you just wanna slog up that hill on the 405 at 4MPH.. Frankly, I think the GTI looks vs WRX looks are a wash, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And no, you don't need AWD. And probably not even extra clearance. But you don't need 200HP either, so forget what you need and get what you want. I can't even get some of my Scoobie pals out to autox, let alone rally, and almost never off pavement. But they still love their cars.. Either car will work fine for you. A new GTI is within that budget (2017 sport GTI package is nice, 2018 GTI warranty is nice). I think you're right; a new WRX would probably be a better deal. Flip coin or just see which you can get the best deal on. And check the insurance rates for each; dunno if they're about the same..

2637,pm-me-ur-car-pic," For reliability, it really depends on how long you plan on keeping the car. Generally Porsche and Mercedes are very reliable for the first 4-5 years but can start having problems after that.. If reliability is extra important, than look at Lexus. They consistently rank above every other brand in reliability, both in the first few years after purchase and long term. They make a great small SUV called the NX. Look for an F-Sport model for a little better driving experience. There is also a hybrid. You could easily pick up an NX300 F-Sport AWD new for well under your budget.. If you want a little bigger SUV, look at the RX. The RX350 F Sport AWD is a great choice and you can find good deals on them used or certified pre owned or even new. I don't drive that much less-engaging than the Q5.. For a more engaging driving experience, look at a Lexus GS350 F-Sport. A used GS might even drive better than a used 5 Series BMW. If you want a really sporty sedan with amazing performance, look into the Lexus GSF (way more aggressive than F-Sport).. If you want a smaller car, look into the Lexus IS350 F Sport. It actually has a lot of nice luxury features for a small car. It isn't great for carrying cargo though because I think the rear seats don't fold down, but I'm not sure on that.. The Macan is a nice SUV and drives better than just about any other SUV. They are expensive though, especially for the level of features, and while it will be probably be reliable up until it's 4-5 years old, it's hard to say after that.. For the extra piece of mind, you could get a car that's Certified Pre Owned. These are used cars which go through an inspection and depending on the manufacturer get 1 to 2 years of extra warranty. They do come at a cost premium versus normal used cars so it's up to you if that's worth it or not..

2639,pm-me-ur-car-pic," A Honda S2000 would be a cool choice for that. They prices are getting a little crazy but they're awesome little sports cars. More reliable than an E46 M3 for sure.. You could also look at an NC Miata with the hard top (PHRT). It will deal better with weather/being outside than any soft top convertible. Look for a 2011+ Miata for a better engine and some interior improvements over the earlier ones. They are actually great to modify even if it's just wheels/tires/coilovers. Get one with an LSD.. As well as the Fiesta ST, also look into the Focus ST. The Focus has more power and is a little more comfortable. More stable at speed too. There are tons of mods for this car like from Mountune and stuff.. A Mk7 GTI is a great choice for a commuter in general. They are super refined and very comfortable for hatchbacks.. Civic Si is another car that's great for modifying or even just commuting. Great shifter..

I love the way it makes me feel when exiting turns, the rear end is extremely (almost too) willing to rotate on throttle. However, it takes an eternity to accelerate on long straights, especially uphill, and the torque dip kills daily driving enjoyment. That being said, it's one of my top choices.. Mazda Miata - There seems to be some reliability issues with the transmission and I would need to weld a 4 point roll bar to it. I would probably get the base model and install aftermarket LSD and coilovers. Haven't driven it yet.. Chevrolet Camaro V6 1LE - Haven't found much information about this car. Seems like a solid choice to consider. Looks like there are some dealers selling them for far below MSRP, which makes it very appealing for my budget.. C6 Z51 Corvette - Probably too fast for me on the track. I don't think I'd feel safe unless it had a roll cage. The same braking zones the BRZ is entering at 100 mph, the Corvette is at 130-140 mph.. Is this your 1st vehicle:  No. Do you need a Warranty:  No. Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:  Tire rotation, brake pad, and brake rotor. That's it..

2665,rbrtow," I feel like an ap2 S2000 fits what you're looking for so well, except for the crash safety part... It did score decently, but with those soft-top bars right next to my head I just can't imagine it would fair well in a side-impact.  Also will require you to install a roll bar, seat, and harness to be 100% safe on track.. ¬†. But dang, for under 20k a reliable car that handles as well as the BRZ with more power... fits the bill pretty damn well.. 10-20 track days, 5-10 non competitive autocross, 1-5 drift events per year.. Is this either/or?  15 track days and 3 drift events in 1 year is a TON of wear on a daily driver.  Have you considered getting something sub 10k specifically for this purpose and then a 10k daily?.

2667,rbrtow," Can't blame ya, a shame about only 1 space, sounds more and more like the ideal situation would be track rat and daily.  Just seems you're asking for trouble putting that much abuse on a daily. Many many smiles will be had, but if you blow a diff, or wreck, it's going to be hard to get to work the next day.. Not to mention tracking a car without a roll bar + seat + harness + hans arguably isn't the safest choice if safety is a big concern.  And of course street driving with those things without a helmet is also not safe..

2670,IKnowNewCars," I'd say Camaro V6 1LE in a heartbeat. You want a car that works as a daily driver but is also killer on the track, and no car can do it better than the Camaro 1LE for $35k or less. Especially if you enjoyed your BRZ but wish it could go faster. After a while, you'll still be wanting for power (that's inevitable with a modern pony car), but the chassis and suspension are . so.  good, you can push the 335 HP engine to its absolute limit and barely scratch the surface on what the rest of the car can handle..

2671,eecsasdf," Have you driven the V6 1LE on the track? It seems very appealing to me, but there isn't any local inventory to test drive. I'm mainly worried about the ""feel"" and driver position.

",Sub_Content, 3 months ago,t1_dvszfq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/83u6za/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
2672,IKnowNewCars," I didn't get to drive it super hard. Driver position will feel similar in nearly any V6 Camaro, but feel is very hard to replicate. It's the only V6 Camaro with staggered tires, summer tires, or a suspension that tight and well tuned. The closest you could get is test driving an RS model (which at least has 20"" wheels with 245/40 tires for a bit more road feel), maybe with the performance exhaust as well, just to give you a taste of the grittier engine sound the 1LE offers. The 1LE is firmer, but I don't get the sense that it would be too firm for a daily driver.. Sadly, the only thing that can replicate a BRZ with more power (in your price range) is exactly that:a BRZ with more power. If you were to opt for a BRZ in Limited trim w/ the Performance Package, then add a forced induction kit of some sort (Sprintex as a great one for $4700 that's 50 state emissions legal). And of course you'll want nicer tires too! I admit that ~$35k seems like a lot for a BRZ, but the power and torque curves on a supercharged BRZ are just perfectly matched to its chassis and suspension..

2688,IKnowNewCars," If the practicality of an electrical vehicle will meet your needs, a Bolt EV is probably your best choice. It's a great car all around, especially when you include the $7500 federal tax credit. Make sure you get it with DC fast-charging capability, it's worth the $750 to be able to charge your battery quickly when you're on the road. It's not a sports car, but it accelerates quickly and is decently nimble.. A GTI would certainly be more fun, but less economical. If you want to split the difference, check out the Volkswagen e-Golf, which was refreshed recently and is certainly the most fun-to-drive electric car in its price range. In a lot of ways it feels like a normal Golf, which is a good thing! DC fast charging costs $1000 for the e-Golf and is worth it here too. Its biggest downside is that its range is only about 125 miles, just over half of the Bolt EV's range, so that could limit its usability. Its starting price is a good bit lower than the Bolt's, though, and the $7500 tax credit still applies..

2689,highly_unlikely1," I've considered the e-Golf, but I just think that 125 is too limiting. Though it would be more than enough for the daily commute, I wouldn't be concerned for really any weekend activities where we tend to be driving all around the city we live in. The 238 estimated range on the Bolt EV seems a bit more realistic. But I've heard bad things about the seats in the Bolt. That may sound like a really picky thing, but comfort is important to me if I will be sitting in stop and go traffic daily.. The GTI seems to be the obvious choice at this time, but I was hoping to get others opinions..

2690,IKnowNewCars," The Bolt's seats aren't super cushy, but depending on how long your commute is, it may or may not make a big difference. You'll have to test drive it and see! Remember that you'll rarely spend more than an hour or two a day in a Bolt (simply because it's an electric car), so a test drive should accurately represent your daily comfort level in one.. The funky thing about the GTI is that it's a sport compact/hot hatch, but it's one of the few that offers an automatic transmission (and a great one at that).  Options like the Honda Civic Si and Ford Focus ST are manual only. You may want to check out the Hyundai Elantra GT Sport, which has an optional dual-clutch automatic and comes standard with leather seats and other nice features. Starting price is around $25k, but you can deck it out with the Technology package for $29k, including a sunroof, navigation, ventilated front seats with lumbar support for the driver's seat, really nice sound system, wireless phone charging pad, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, and front crash prevention. It won't be quite as sporty or fun as the GTI, but you'll have a quick, refined hatchback with a nice interior and tons of features, plus one of the best warranties on the market, for under $30k MSRP.. If you want something fun to drive but don't need it to be super sporty, you could deck out a Mazda 3 hatchback with an automatic transmission in Grand Touring trim with the Premium package for $27k. It's fun to drive, though not as quick as the Elantra GT Sport or GTI, but it also has the nicest interior for the money..

2708,IKnowNewCars," I had a feeling haha. It's honestly a great, unique car. But I can't recommend buying a car that doesn't meet your needs in regards to practicality. You know how it goes. But that doesn't mean you have to settle!. If a pickup is going to give you the most utility (and you'll actually use the bed, 4x4, towing, etc), the Colorado is a solid choice. It's practical, capable, and roomy with a crew cab. If you think you'll actually take it off-roading, the ZR2 is an absolute blast, but it does start around $43k. My favorite balance of features and value would be a Crew Cab model with 4WD, the V6 engine, in LT trim. Add the Luxury package and you'll have a well-equipped pickup for just under $38k.. The new Ford Ranger looks pretty awesome too, but to be honest, my favorite mid-size pickup on the market is actually the Honda Ridgeline. I know, it doesn't give you the same rugged feeling of an American truck. But it does nearly everything the others can do, has some nice features they don't have, comes with a very nice interior for the price, and drives more like a car than truck, all of which adds up to a great value to me. Check out the RTL trim w/ AWD, and for $37k, you get one of the nicest-riding pickups on the market, plus leather seats and tons of convenient features (like the dual-action tailgate, in-bed trunk, lift-up rear seats, and tri-zone climate control).. If you decide you don't need a pickup, there are plenty of crossovers these days that are surprisingly fun to drive! In your budget you can go for top-trim decked-out version of the Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5, or Subaru Forester XT. If you need more space, the Ford Edge Sport is a blast to drive and incredibly quick, while the Mazda CX-9 is very sporty with a very nice interior and the Volkswagen Atlas has nice driving dynamics with a very spacious interior and cargo area.. The upcoming 2019 Volvo V60 looks like it could be awesome, but in my opinion, the current 2018 model is really only worth it if you can spring for the upper trim levels, like the Cross Country Platinum. That sort of gorgeous interior, plus its reputation for safety, are what sets it apart from the few other wagons on the market. Though if you're interested in a wagon, it would help to check out the VW Golf Sportwagen and Alltrack, and maybe the Buick Regal TourX too!.

2709,judsonzhao," Wow thank you for so much input. We are looking at the Colorado Z71, my local dealers seem they want to work out deals, so that looks promising.. Yeah I've heard a lot of Ridgeline, I should check it out for sure. It happens this Chevy/GMC dealer is on my way home everyday lol.. I'm thinking if we really go for SUV then we want the 3rd row as our parents visits a lot. CX-9 is definitely on the radar (my GF has a Mazda 3 and it's pretty nice), but intuitively it looks bit under-powered. My local dealership started to have XC90 CPOs and they slowly get into the lower 40k range which is pretty much top of my budget.. The reason for V60, is really it's kind of a soft spot in my heart.. Also seems my local Volvo dealer always discounted T8 models heavily by the end of the year, together with the tax credit, there's a chance I can score a V60 T8 for a good price, plus they provide slightly above average trade-in values and loyalty cash. I know I'm little bit wishful thinking but it's a 400hp wagon... ",Sub_Content, 3 months ago,t1_dvqxthn,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/83u6za/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
2710,IKnowNewCars," The CX-9 does seem less powerful than its competitors at first glance, given it has a turbo-4 instead of a V6, but 250 HP and 310 lb-ft of torque helps the CX-9 run 0-60 in 7.1 seconds, which is faster than a XC90 T5 and about average in its class. The CX-9 also manages to be one of the most fuel-efficient 3-row models on the road.. I love the XC90, but to me it truly stands out in one of the upper trim levels with the T6 powertrain. Otherwise, there are other options that provide similar performance and comfort, usually with a better record for reliability. But it's certainly worth a test drive if you can't keep your eye off it (and I know it looks great).. Now a T8 V60, that's quite a proposition! I don't have much experience with that configuration, so I can't say much about it except that if it's a good deal, it's a good deal!.

2711,OUGrad05," I like this mega thread, mods might prefer I make my own thread but let's start here first... Current garage:2013 Scion FR-S 2015 BMW 335i M Sport 2015 Lexus RX. The Lexus is staying no matter what, we have CPO unlimited mile warranty and we pile miles on that car.... However, my BMW and Scion will probably go before the end of the year.. Location:Oklahoma. Price range:Max on single car $55k, max between both cars 75k. Lease or Buy:Buy. New or used:CPO or used. Type of vehicle:Likely car(s) but that's part of the fun of this discussion. Must haves:Decent build quality, good warranty, one of the two, if not both need to be trackable, I actually take my cars to the track (road course not drag race). Desired transmission (auto/manual, etc):Prefer at least one manual. Intended use:DD/DD rotation/Track. Vehicles you've already considered: Is this your 1st vehicle:No. Do you need a Warranty:On primary yes, secondary doesn't matter. Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:If needed, but prefer not to, do this from time to time, brakes, oil, etc. Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:No. Additional Notes:Considering BMW M3, Lexus GSF, Chevrolet SS, these would be excellent DD's with lots of power, weekend car would probably remain the FR-S in any of the above.  Other cars in contention for primary DD role, Honda Accord, Golf GTI If going Accord or GTI would consider something like a Cayman S or Corvette C6 - Grand Sport (love these cars).. The true cost to own of the Corvette is significantly less than the Cayman, I have access to a buddies garage/tools that would make working on the Vette much easier than the Porsche.  I've owned a C5 Z06 in the past, fun car, track worthy but tough to drive during the week.  The C6 is quieter, better built and has bluetooth which would allow some calls while driving one or two days a week to the office.. I've always been a sports sedan guy so there is tremendous appeal for an M3 or GSF.  To be honest, yes the M3 is more capable but the GSF is probably the front runner, slightly bigger inside, very well put together.  Excellent warranty and our Lexus dealer experience is much better than BMW here.  I can also be assured that the Lexus will take track days and eat them up with no reliability issues.  I also suspect the GSF will hold its value better than the M3.. Another possible combination would be GSF + C5 Coupe... What else am I missing or should I consider?  The cost to own on the GTI and Accord are really low which is appealing, but I do earn a good living and I like cars so spending some money on vehicles is OK too.. What's Reddit think?.

2713,OUGrad05," Depends on the car...if it were a 911 it would remain mostly stock, perhaps intake and/or exhaust.. Corvette?  Probably similar easy bolt-ons and brakes if it were a C6 GS.  If I went C5 I'd probably be a little less picky so if a car had a cam or something similar I wouldn't be opposed if the top end was built accordingly.. In my experience tracking a car, you can have fun with very little power but where most cars get into trouble is on the braking end of things.  Some cars have adequate brakes (my 335i and Z06 which I no longer own), some cars have good brakes (Porsche and BMW M cars for example) but Corvette's for example (Z06 exception) generally have inadequate brakes for road course racing.

2721,JesusSama," Hi there, your price range is pretty easy to work with.... So, you're looking for two different cars, is that correct? If that's the case, there's some flexibility if you're looking between the GTI/Accord for sure, but with your price range, I just wanted to point out that the Golf R is attainable along with the Accord . with a used Golf R going for under $34k near Oklahoma City.  and it would be the best of both worlds for . performance and fuel economy per in depth review by C&amp;D.. The Golf R is basically the premium version of the Golf/GTI and the step up where you can get 0-60 in 4.5 (auto) or 0-60 in 4.8 (Manual) while getting 23 city/30 highway (EPA ratings for auto) or 22/31 with manual.. You'd get the perfect blend of fuel economy over other similar cars - Lexus GSF is 16/24 MPG with 0-60 at 4.4 while the Corvette is 15/25 with 0-60 at 4.0 - along with great performance and tracking potential. And, with a $600 tune, you'd be able to bump your performance even further to match if not beat the GSF/Corvette while maintaining that edge in fuel economy.. So, you can have your fun car and pick up a DD that's still a fun car (Golf R) for your consideration. Give it a test drive and I think you might be VERY happy..

2725,IKnowNewCars," Comparing the three cars you're considering, they're basically a sliding scale between ""maximum fun w/ little practicality"" and ""lots of fun with more practicality."" If a Miata RF meets your needs as far as passenger space and cargo room go, that would be my pick in a heartbeat. The pricing seems a lot higher than the soft top, but since its base model is the Club trim, the price difference is less than $3k. And it's still one of the must fun-to-drive affordable sports cars ever, coming in around $33k. But I totally get if you'd want something more different from your NA Miata!. The 86/BRZ is an awesome inexpensive sports car in and of itself, though it's difficult to compete with the Miata. Still a very pure, enthusiast-friendly driving experience though. If you decide that more cargo space and a back seat (albeit a small one) are important for your practicality needs, or if you test drive it and just like it better than the Miata, it's a solid choice. Since your budget is up to $35k, I highly recommend checking out the Subaru BRZ in Limited trim with the Performance Package. This gets you a nicer interior with Alcantara/leather seats, plus nicer/wider wheels, upgraded brakes, and sportier dampers/shocks for just over $30k.. While the two true RWD sports would be the most enthusiast-friendly experience out there, some of us need 4 doors and/or a flexible cargo area, and that's where a sport compact comes into play. The Focus ST is a fantastic deal precisely because you can get it for so cheap compared to its MSRP. I highly recommend you check out Equipment Group 401A (also called ST2), which includes Recaro seats and the Sync 3 infotainment system, among other nice features (though you should thoroughly test out the Recaros first to make sure they're not too narrow for you). The FoST has a decent chassis with a 250 HP engine that overpowers it around corners, and that's half the fun! Even with FWD, understeer is kept in check decently well and oversteer is available when you want it. MSRP approaches $30k, but paying under $25k is common for a new FoST w/ Recaros.. Other sporty compacts I think you should try out include the Subaru WRX (Premium trim w/ Performance Package costs $32k MSRP and gets your AWD and about the best track performance for the money), Volkswagen GTI (SE trim is $31k MSRP blends refinement and performance incredibly well), and the Civic Si (w/ optional summer tires, it's one of the best-handling FWD cars out there, costing only $25k MSRP)..

I'm not partial to any brand, but would like to steer clear of German cars (had a VW TDI that got snatched up in the diesel debacle, and friends have had terrible experiences with other German makes).

2746,gibson85," SAAB. I'm at that point where . this lovely vehicle.  is getting old; it has already been towed once (nothing major; a spark plug came loose so I had those replaced + a coil pack) and I am leery to trust it as my daily driver. It is in excellent condition, no rust, always garaged, synthetic oil changes, etc.. My local shops are always a pain about it whenever it needs some kind of service (other than inspection/brakes/oil changes) because it's a Saab. The only place that doesn't give me the old ""oh, it's a Saab, ugh"" is the Audi dealership that sold it to me but I might as well take a second job if I continue to bring it there.. Is it time to sell or trade in? The trade-in value is less than 3k which just blows my mind (well, it IS a dead company after all). Should I get rid of it while it's still worth a positive amount? Or wait for it to fully break down and then make a shrine out of it in my backyard because it isn't worth the metal it's made of?. BMW. There's a 2015 BMW 228i that has caught my eye in my area for under $25k with 16k miles and CPO. I'd have warranty until Nov 2020, AWD, and just an overall nicer vehicle. The seats are brown (meh) and not powered (disappointing) but it is much sportier and has AWD. I live in an incredibly snowy area and usually run snow tires on my SAAB, but the BMW is a tad bit lower so ground clearance with snow is certainly an issue (and I'm not certain AWD would be enough to avoid having to switch to snows every year)..

2749,IKnowNewCars," I think any number of the sports sedans or luxury sedans you can buy for $40-45k could be fantastic options. My suggestion is simply to test drive a bunch of them in their best configurations if possible: Audi A4 Quattro in Premium Plus trim. Mercedes-Benz C300 4Matic (AMG Line is great but over your budget). Kia Stinger Premium AWD or GT AWD (GT1 is great but over your budget). Buick Regal GS. Acura TLX 3.5 SH-AWD (maybe A-Spec, but it's expensive for what you get). There are plenty of decent SUV/crossovers you can choose from as well, but if a sedan meets your needs, you'll have a more fun time driving one than something with an increased ride height. If you need decent storage space, the Stinger and Regal GS have hatchbacks, as would the Audi A5 Sportback (maybe test drive one with the S Line Sport Package).. One more thing:On the Audi and some other models, you get a choice between summer tires and all season tires. It's tempting to pick all-seasons and use them all year round, but I highly recommend going with summer tires instead, then buying a set of cheap wheels (probably steelies) and snow tires for use when it's snowing. Not only will you have . much.  more fun driving during the non-winter months with better performing summer tires, but you'll be much safer and more capable driving in the snow with winter tires. Remember that even a FWD car with snow tires is better in the snow than an AWD car with all-season tires..

Any of those cars are going to be quick and fun, but 25 mile commutes can get exhausting day in and day out if the car is uncomfortable. Personally I wouldn't go with a truck. Comfy and practical (and cool) as they are, you already have one. Wouldn't you want the option to have a different driving experience?.

Thanks in advance for any help and guidance!. Location:Central NC (currently in school in Charlotte, planning on living/working/continuing education in Raleigh or Chapel Hill, lived in Raleigh) but more than willing to go pick up or have delivered the perfect car for me. Price range:~$45-$50k. Lease or buy:Probably buy. New or used:doesn't matter so long as it's clean. Type of vehicle:I'm in love with the idea of a hot-wagon.  I would love the practicality and uniqueness of a wagon, but I know they are sort of hard to come by here in the US.  Also open to sedans, hatchbacks, MAYBE even a coupe if you can convince me. Must haves:RWD or AWD/4WD, no replacement for displacement, at least 300-350hp with potential for more, practicality and hopefully longterm reliability (I know it might cost me but I plan on taking good care of the car and performing all preventative maintenance needed).  Luxury would be nice (leather seats, nice sound system, heated seats, safety features, etc.) but not crucial. Desired transmission:wanting to learn manual, but not a dealbreaker. Intended used:Daily Driver but enough of a car to have fun with (maybe very minor modding in the future). Vehicles you've already considered:Basically, what I think I'm looking for is the closest thing to an RS6 or S6 Avant that I can get in the best condition in the US for around $45k give or take.  I love the looks to begin with, but a quick-but-not-wild wagon that is not too aggressive to stand out a ton but still catches the eye of those that are looking is ideal.

Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:I intend to get into that yes.  It can't be that hard to start with the basics, watch tutorials and youtube videos, and learn my way around. Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:no, I lack the tools and the know-how. Additional Notes:I think I've said pretty much all I have to say.  I'm looking for something practical with space for a large-ish dog, maybe kids in the future, but something that is unique and fun, that I can do a little bit of work on myself, and that I can keep running for some time if I take care of it.

Hey everyone. Thanks in advance for any advice. Looking to pick up another vehicle to replace my aging Mazda 3 in 3-4 months.. I work full time as a Realtor. I do a lot of city and highway driving, probably 100km/day no problem.. I'm looking for something that is reliable, good on gas, and workable in the city. I'm not really to hyped up about SUVs in general.. I'm a ""weekend mechanic"", I love working on cars. I actually just bought a quickjack so I can get more things done. I can change any oils, brakes, and so forth on my own.. I'm looking for something that is reliable, presentable, and easy to work on.. I've had a couple ideas in mind. Was thinking about getting a Scion xB as it seems like a great combination. Corolla sized, bulletproof camry engine, and tons of space for carrying people and stuff for the occasional (hopefully more frequent) road trips. Seems like a great all-arounder.. I've also been thinking about perhaps a camry hybrid, although I have no experience with hybrid systems and have heard that the battery system occasionally needs replacing for 3-5k.. I've also though of perhaps getting a newer, 2nd gen Mazda 3 hatch. Pretty much what I have now but newer, however I'm concerned about the rusting of it. Gen 1 rusts out quick, not sure if they fixed it later on. Hoping to keep this car for a while. I don't care much for how the vehicle drives, in terms of performance. Comfort would be more important with long hours in the vehicle. I've got the Miata for the fun and 6spd when I want it :.

2851,mhaggin," Not a BMW guy by any means so take what I say with a grain of salt.. I'd suggest Craigslist, filter by transmission and alternate searching specifically for ""e30,"" but also search by individual years. Not all listings will have a year and not all will have e30 in them. You could check out some forums but you may pay a ""hype"" tax for a clean e30 there. If you buy from a caring enthusiast, the risk is likely lower.. In addition, forums like . Bimmerfest.  may suit you well:that link is specifically to the Cali regional section. From a quick look, they have a few classifieds there, but not only e30s.. I have a friend who swapped a newer entire drivetrain into his e30 325i, and while he's fairly mechanically inclined it looked like a relatively simple job for the magnitude of his efforts. I think you could learn on an e30 just fine, given you put enough effort in.. And finally, my last piece of advice is to just take your time. There are a lot of thrashed-to-hell e30s out there, and sometimes they're in disguise, so use your best judgement and don't get antsy. You could always snag this . e30 pickup truck in LA..

2884,IKnowNewCars," I'd rule out the WRX is a smooth ride and decent interior are on your list. It's a great car, but it prioritizes performance and handling over daily driver comfort, and its non-linear power delivery isn't all that smooth.. To be honest, if you decide to go new vs used, the new Accord Sport 2.0T would be a great way to go. They've done such a great job of balancing a sporty chassis and torque-y engine (the same one as the Civic Type R, de-tuned to 252 HP) with a spacious, comfortable interior and solid feature set for the price. The manual is a blast, but the new 10-speed auto is great too. It won't be as sporty as a used RWD/AWD sports sedan, but I'd at least test drive it before ruling it out.. There's one more option you should really check out:the GTI. Few cars balance sport and refinement so well in your price range. Opt for the SE trim, and while the manual transmission is very well done, the dual-clutch auto is almost as much fun. The MSRP comes out to $32k, but you should be able to get this down to $30k. On top of that, all 2018 VW models come with a 6 year/72k mile bumper-to-bumper warranty. The back seat won't be as spacious as the Accord, but it'll be just as quick, more nimble, and more fun to drive.. Edit:  I tend to focus more on new options than used ones, but that doesn't mean there aren't some great used options on the market too! Other folks can give you suggestions on that front..

I think the R/T comes in RWD or AWD, and it's got amazing power. The Ford Taurus also has AWD available, it's very roomy, and is arguably the most reliable car I've mentioned so far. I also like the Buick Lucerne. Great sleeper with the V8, and also very reliable. You might also consider a Kia Forte hatchback if you can't find the Sedan you like. It's very roomy for how small it is, and the higher trim levels get some decent power. An even roomier hatchback would be the Kia Soul, but it's not exactly a fun car. Hella reliable though. The Mazda3 on the other hand is a pretty sporty little hatch. Amazing interior space as well, and of course, reliable. The Hyundai Elantra GT follows the same pattern of roomy and reliable, but even with the name ""GT"" it's not that powerful. (And sorry, I don't know of many wagons unfortunately)..

2909,JesusSama," Mazda3 will be more fun, VW Golf is refined fun with a blend between performance/practicality. Honda Civic would definitely be more practical of the choices unless you go with sportier trims of it. But that will be much higher in price range.. Both the Mazda3 and Golf will be around that budget range for an older model, though I would say go with at least a '16 Golf for extra tech or '14-16 for the Mazda3..

2913,bowfryfrenchtie," A Civic would be more family-friendly than fun, but if you can sacrifice that a Civic is a great choice. Certain trims of the Golf and the Mazda3 are pretty similar, so this comes down to personal preference (I think the Mazda3 sounds more fun, but the Golf seems more practical). The Fit is similar to the Civic. It's not the most fun, but it's a good family car. The Focus though, it's a mixed bag. Some people don't have any problems from them, but I've read multiple cases of transmission and electrical problems. Of course any of these cars are subject to problems, but I've heard it more so about the Focus. You could also look into the Chevrolet Cruze and the Dodge Dart if you're interested in a sedan. I've heard mixed things about them as well, but not nearly to the extent of the Focus..

EPA Reported fuel economy is 25 city/35 highway with 29 being combined. Actual testing reflects 40 highway (cruise control, 75 mph and tested over a 200 mile course). Some people on Reddit have posted above even 40; I recall seeing one at 42mpg for a commute/trip.. I would normally call BS on something like this BUT I found it accurate in my GTI as I'm getting (with cruise at 70-75, 40 mile one way commute, 85-90% highway) anywhere from 34-38 mpg (EPA rated is 33).

Reliability is subjective because you're not going to 100% get the same experience that somebody else had. Some people drive their BMWs into the ground at well about 200k miles, some don't last half that. It really comes down to the user, preventative maintenance and really taking care of the car. I think Japanese cars are better made to take the abuse of ignoring routine/preventative maintenance but that shit's going to cost the same as a German car when something goes wrong..

2999,IKnowNewCars," Your submission is a bit all over the place. You want to lease a new car, but you mention a used BMW as a possibility. You want a sedan, but two of the vehicles you mention don't come in sedan form. So if I boil this down a bit, it sounds like you want this sort of car: Fun to drive, and ideally quick too. Smooth enough for daily driving, not just track oriented. You want the car to be practical, as long as it still has a fun driving experience. Putting these together, my first recommendation would be a Volkswagen Golf GTI. It's the original hot hatch, a practical car that's also a blast to drive, as well as comfortable and refined. A 220 HP turbo-4 might not seem like a ton of power, but with the dual-clutch automatic transmission (one of the best in its price range), it should hit 0-60 in 5.6 seconds. If you can find a 2018 model in SE trim, you'll get a limited-slip differential and other performance upgrades, plus lots of nice features, for just over $32k MSRP (before discounts and incentives). You can swap out the classic plaid seats for leather upholstery for $700 if you want. Not only will you have an absolute blast driving it, but the hatchback body style lets you fold down the back seats and fit a ton of cargo whenever you need to. Lastly, VW's 2018 models all come with a new 6 year/72k mile bumper-to-bumper warranty that's certainly hard to pass up.. If you decide the GTI isn't for you, consider some other options: The Honda Accord will have a more spacious interior than the GTI, though with a trunk instead of a hatchback. The optional 2.0T engine, new for 2018, can run 0-60 in 5.5 seconds, and while it won't feel as sporty or nimble as the GTI, the Sport trim w/ 2.0T engine and 10-speed automatic does a great job of balancing fun and practicality for $31k MSRP.. I'm a Mustang guy, so I'll try not to be biased here, but if you do decide that you can get away with 2 doors and a smaller trunk, the new 2018 Mustang is a great way to go. There's tons of ways to configure it too. An EcoBoost Mustang w/ Equipment Group 101A (essential for the Sync 3 infotainment system), 10-speed auto, and Performance Package comes out to $31k for a fun to drive, fuel efficient ride that can hold its own on twisty roads. To add leather seats, move up to the EcoBoost Premium, costing $34k with the same 10-speed auto and Performance Package. Moving up to the GT will cost you almost $40k if you add Equipment Group 301A and the 10-speed auto, but you can save some money at the dealership with a bit of negotiation. Any of these models can be configured with the MagneRide suspension for an extra $1700, which allows you to change the stiffness and handling ability of your ride on the fly, a pretty cool feature for a sporty daily driver.. If you want something similar to the Mustang in terms of sportiness, but with a performance edge, I'd check out the Chevy Camaro. If you configure it properly, you can have a daily driver that's an absolute blast to drive:Start with the Camaro V6, check out the 2LT trim for leather seats and other features, add the RS package, then pick the 8-speed auto transmission. You're looking at $36k before incentives and discounts for a car that probably drives as well as the used BMWs you're thinking about, but with more power, a cooler look, and a decently nice interior. Keep in mind though that the interior won't be quite as nice as a similarly-priced Mustang, and the Camaro's visibility is certainly lacking.. Edit:  Typo.

3027,Starace01," So if you are inexperienced buyer do more research than just asking the internet, check the specs on . the.  car you want (Horsepower, weight, wheelbase, torque are all major factors in performance) and use those specs to help you ballpark the type of performance you are comfortable with ( but A:dont take spec sheets as god's word for how a car performs and B:accept that what you can afford is likely lower performance than what you want)  test drive, test drive, test drive! someone told you a car was fast? test drive it. like the look of a car? test drive it. think a car has potential? test drive it. again a spec sheet doesn't completely dictate how a car drives. You have the luxury of time to search and test drive, use it (you might test drive 15 cars before you find the right one).. WRX and WRX STI's (and the nissans you seem interested in) at that price point are all going to be alot of work. The base Golf and Civics (nobody hates on civics btw, there's a ton more hate for WRX bro's tbh) are not going to be fast cars at all, their performance models the Civic Si and Golf GTI (the Type R and golf R are way outta your price range)will be much quicker cars look into those at your price point. Honestly a Civic Si sounds perfect, they are great first builds because they can take a beating and are forgiving to inexperienced enthusiasts.. Also don't use the term JDM unless you are refering specifically to parts/cars that are strictly Japanese (like only sold in japan ex:Skyline GTR)  market, you sound like an idiot to other enthusiast using it otherwise (hope you understand i mean no offense, there was definitely a time i didn't understand the term).

3039,IKnowNewCars," Replacement for an AWD Mercedes wagon for under $28k:my absolute first choice would be a VW Golf Alltrack. It's based on the Golf hatchback which is one of the nicest-driving compacts on the market, with a wagon body style that maximizes the cargo area, standard AWD with off-road mode, and an increased ride height with rugged body cladding to give it a competitive edge over the Subaru Outback. The base Alltrack S trim w/ dual-clutch automatic transmission comes out to $28k MSRP before incentives and dealer discounts. And all 2018 models come with VW's new 6 year/72k mile warranty, which makes reliability less of an issue.. The Outback has a little more off-road prowess than the Alltrack, the base engine is a bit more fuel efficient, and its cargo area is bigger. Having said that, it's not quite as comfortable, the base engine is rather slow, its only transmission option needs some work, and it's simply not as fun to drive. A base Outback S would be $1000 less than a base Alltrack S, but includes cloth seats (the Alltrack has standard leatherette seats) and lacks lots of standard features. The Outback Premium costs $1000 more than the Alltrack S and adds fog lights, heated seats, and a leather wrapped steering wheel (all of which is already standard on the base Alltrack), as well as dual-zone climate control, a feature that would require the top-level SEL trim on the Alltrack..

Type of vehicle:Fun car as a daily driver/alternative to my motorcycle. Must haves:Manual transmission, RWD, fun. LSD is preferred. Desired transmission (auto/manual, etc):Manual. Intended use:Daily driver/fun car. Vehicles you've already considered:Last-gen V6 Mustang, Mazda Miata NA. Old BMW M3s. Please suggest things I haven't thought of. I don't think Crown Vics came in manual, but anything that fits my suggestions I want to hear about. Though, if I buy an 80s Corolla my friends would never shut up about the Initial D mobile.. Is this your 1st vehicle:It'll be the first car I've owned, but I own a motorcycle and have driven a Chevy Trailblazer and a Chevy Silverado.. Do you need a Warranty:Nope. Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:I enjoy doing this kind of work. Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:After doing an motor swap with a friend and his Grand Marquis:Nah.. Additional Notes:It needs to run well enough to drive every day. I won't have a problem changing my own oil or anything, but honestly I don't have a clue what to look for in a car to know it won't blow up on the highway.. I'm leaning heavily toward the Mazda Miata, but if any of you happen to know that a Chevrolet Silverado 4.8l V8 fits in a last-gen V6 Mustang I'll happily work that out.. I've found a Mazda B2300 from '94 with 212k miles on it, had ""new timing belt, crank sensor, water pump and much more"". Asking price 2700 USD, if I want it I wouldn't spend more than 2500 after ALL taxes, title, etc.. It doesn't look like shit, though it does look well used.

3070,IKnowNewCars," Welp, you have all the options ever: Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio. Best sports sedan on the market. It's only $75k, but that means you have $25k left for all the repairs you'll need to have done! Regardless, no car feels like the Giulia QF. It's absolutely unique. It's not a V8, but its twin-turbo V6 makes over 500 HP, shares its engine design with Ferrari, and sounds like it too.. Mercedes-AMG C63 S. A different kind of sports sedan absurdity. Gorgeous interior and beauitful twin-turbo V8 power. Doesn't have quite the feel of the Giulia QF, but it's just as thrilling to floor it, and the luxury aspect is hard to beat.. Mercedes-AMG E63 S. This might be the fastest sedan in the world. Again, absurd and beautiful. Comparing this to a decked-out C63 S will require you to answer one simple question:Would you rather have bells and whistles (autonomous driving, etc), or even more power, comfort, and space? I'd pick an E63 S, personally. Even bone stock, it's nearly perfect. I'd personally add the $1250 AMG Performance Exhaust as the only necessary option. And actually, I'd pick the E63 S Wagon over the Sedan, given the choice, because owning the Unicorn that's even more practical for almost the same price is a chance I would never pass up.. Cadillac CTS-V. Like the other dude mentioned, the CTS-V exists, and it's probably the best deal in the sub-$100k sports sedan world. It's got the same supercharged V8 as the Corvette Z06 and Camaro ZL1. The interior won't be as nice as the Mercedes, but it'll be even more thrilling, with 640 HP and a top speed of 200 MPH. You won't know what you're missing until you test drive it.. Picking between these 4 cars is crazy difficult. Test drive them and pick the one you like best. End of story..

If you're only going to keep it for a few years while you have a specific job or commute, though, going CPO makes a lot of sense.. Other options exist if you decide to go new as well. The new Hyundai Ioniq beats out the Prius in terms of both MPG and price, and the driving experience is a bit nicer in my opinion. The Ioniq Blue is the most fuel efficient (57/59 MPG) for $23k, while the Ioniq SEL (55/54 MPG) has some nicer features and still beats out the regular Prius in terms of efficiency for less than $25k. The Kia Niro uses the same technology as the Ioniq but in a practical crossover body style, so you can try out the $24k FE trim for max MPG (52/49), or the LX trim (51/46 MPG) which has more features for only $300 more..

3120,MDEX357," (USA) Looking to buy a car sometime this year. I've been interested in Subarus (Crosstrek, Outback, Forester, Impreza) and was wondering what you guys would recommend of those four? I need something reliable and that performs. I live in the Midwest so I drive in all types of weather and I commute to work and school and pretty much drive all over the place.. ",Main_Content, 4 months ago,t1_dtxn4r6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7ve46u/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
3121,IKnowNewCars," Your practicality needs are going to dictate which of those four is best for you: The Impreza is a compact car (think Honda Civic, Mazda 3, etc). It comes in sedan and hatchback forms, with the latter being generally considered the more practical of the two. It's the cheapest way to get AWD in today's new car market.. The Crosstrek is basically an Impreza hatchback that has an increased ride height, rugged body cladding, and an off-road mode. In other words, it's an Impreza crossover (competing with the Mazda CX-3, Jeep Renegade, etc). The 2018 got the same redesign as the 2017 Impreza. If your bad weather and off-road needs require a bit more ground clearance and a slightly more rugged chassis, this will do the trick.. The Forester is Subaru's compact crossover (think Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5, etc). It has the same ride height as the Crosstrek in a more traditional crossover shape, with a lot more cargo space and a bigger engine. There's also the Forester XT, which has a 250 HP turbo engine, the fastest acceleration in its class, and some other improvements to the driving experience.. The Outback is a station wagon crossover thing. It's not quite like the old Volvo wagons we had growing up, since it's lifted (as much as the Crosstrek and Forester) and has that same plastic body cladding as the Crosstrek. Bigger cargo area than the Forester and a more off-road friendly chassis. It has very few direct competitors:the VW Golf Alltrack, maybe the new Buick Regal TourX... that's it.. If you want performance, the Forester XT is your bet bet of the 4. It also includes selectable drive modes that make the CVT less annoying to live with on a daily basis..

3125,IKnowNewCars," Good suggestions from the other folks. I'll add that if I was in your shoes, I'd take a close look at the Mazda 3 hatch, for a few reasons. First of all, you want an automatic, and the Mazda's auto option is one of the more fun to drive ones in its price range (the Civic's CVT is surprisingly good, but I find it less sporty overall). Second, it has the nicest interior for the price. If you can afford the Grand Touring trim ($25,835 MSRP before incentives and dealer discounts), you'll have incredibly nice leather seats, a Bose sound system, and a fit and finish you'd expect in a much more expensive car. Plus the 2.5L engine, well-made chassis, and responsive steering come together to make something truly fun for a FWD not-quite-hot hatch.. Yes, road and wind noise are more present in the Mazda 3 than its competitors, and the ride quality isn't as smooth as some. But it would certainly be comfortable enough for me as a daily driver, and I prefer to have a little fun during my drive anyway! So you'll have to test drive it and see what you think. Compare it to the Honda Civic Hatch EX (or EX-L Navi, depending on pricing and budget) as well as the 2017 VW Golf Wolfsburg (or maybe the 2018 GTI S, again depending on pricing). The 2018 Golf hasn't hit dealerships yet, but when it does, the Golf SE or SEL w/ auto transmission might be worth checking out too..

3164,upsidedownfunnel," This makes little to no sense.. First of all, leases are generally only for new cars. Used car leases are fairly rare.. When you lease, you basically don't have to worry about depreciation. Why are you trying to minimize depreciation? You should only be considering how much money you pay over the life of your lease.. Also, why is your range so wide? Why consider both a C250 and a C350? Why not an E Class? An R8 could not be further from the C250 in a lot of different ways. Why are you looking for exactly?. There's no point in trying to justify this as not being ""daddy's money."" The most cynical among us will not buy it and just think you're a spoiled rich kid. Otherwise, most people simply do not care. Adding that detail makes you seem more defensive which means you're hiding something. I personally just do not care..

I personally do not like Audis, but most people seem to like them. Someone in your demographic usually likes the flashy technology and excellent interior and exterior design of the car. While some may say the car is safe and/or boring, no one can deny they still look extremely sharp and professional.. Since your price range is all over the place, you might as well consider the S4 and S8 as well. The S8 is a bit out of your price range, but who knows what your actual price range is. I think the first thing you need to do is set a tighter price range. Why do you have such a wide range? If you're spending $90,000 on a car at &lt;20 years old, why do you seem to care so much about insurance? Just a bit of advice:if you're sitting on some type of settlement or inheritance or otherwise random influx of cash, do not allow that cash to influence your car price range. Only buy the car you can afford with your salary. (Unless your influx of cash is &gt; $10 million. Then you can afford to spend a bit of money on a nice car..

Sorry for the long explanation.. TL:R.  at the top:Own 2 cars currently, neither really worth selling, neither perfect for what I want. Power and comfort + engine reliability.. Have wife's old 2008 Matrix, super reliable, pretty boring. Have my ""old"" 2001 Mustang GT - blown a spark plug twice out the head due to a . vulnerability.  no one warned me about in this 4.6l engine when I first bought it.  Last time cost me 1.7k as they had to rebuild an entirely different head.. Options I've considered: Toyota Avalon (super boring I know) almost 300hp, not a slouch on the freeway, actually only 200lbs heavier than my current Mustang.. 2015+ Coyote - Fast, styling I love, power, but maybe not the highest build quality b/c Ford.. E46 M3 - Reliability? Not the best sound? However supposedly an awesome driver's car and fun/fast and a lot less electrical issues than most BMW's.. Coyote Swap - Just rip my engine out, sell it to help offset pumping up to a Coyote build in my current Mustang. Downsides are - older, transmission, no independent rear suspension. However mine is already lowered, on sport suspension, fat tires in the back, and it was my first big purchase I made for myself when I got my post college job.. Are there obvious choices I'm forgetting? I definitely lean towards ""toss you back"" power over Miata/Toyota86 handling.  To each their own, not knocking either...  But I COULD have a ""project car"" in a build since I can daily the Matrix in the meantime (bought the wife another car last month).  My Mustang only has 80k miles on it right now, even though it's a 2001. I bought it in 2010 with a mere 5300 miles so I've basically had it since ""new""..

3189,bowfryfrenchtie," I'd recommend an older Honda Accord (like pre-2005; should fall in your price range). You'd get Honda reliability from something that isn't a Civic, and they're pretty common.

I'm a sucker for General Motors cars like the Pontiac Bonneville and the Cadillac CTS, but I don't know if they're as reliable as some other options out there.

3206,GentlemanShark1," I can recommend McLarens. McLaren of San Francisco (even if the showroom is in Palo Alto) is very accommodating and offers a decent selection.. If you want something that offers more creature comforts, Porsche is a solid go to. You've got a range of options like the GT3RS or Cayman GT4 (personally, I prefer the Cayman), or the GT2 RS if you want to stretch your budget a bit. Porsche of Steven's Creek should be taking on a GT3RS soon, so I would check with them if you don't want to wait.. I personally don't have much experience with any of the Italian stallions, but those can be tons of fun. My recommendation is to take a look digitally and find cars that you love the looks of and then reduce that list on ones you like the performance of.

3208,northwoods23," Location:  Great Lakes region. Price range:  ~$35k or less is ideal, $45k maximum. Lease or Buy:  Buy. New or used:  New. Type of vehicle:  Sedan. Must haves:  Would like heated leather seats. Desired transmission:  Auto. Intended use:  Daily Driver. Currently considering: Me:Buick LaCrosse or Regal, Acura TLX, Volvo S60, Jaguar XE. Also interested in Cadillac, Infiniti, and Lincoln but haven't looked much. Wife:German entry level luxury car, Lexus ES, she also is interested in most cars I listed except for Buick and Volvo.. Is this your 1st vehicle:  First as a married couple. Do you need a Warranty:  I'm thinking yes. Advice?. Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:  No. Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:  No. Additional Notes:  As I said above, this will be our first car we're buying as a married couple. I currently drive an '06 corolla that's in great condition, but we have been wanting to buy a new vehicle for a while. My wife will drive my corolla, so it's not going to be traded in. My wife is just a bit more brand-conscious than I am, and really into the iconic luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes; although I've made some headway in selling her on the 2018 LaCrosse. I'm very impressed by the new Buicks, so the LaCrosse is currently my top choice. I would want the Essence package, as that is the lowest trim that comes with heated leather (appointed) seats.. My biggest concern about the German cars is the cost of upkeep. I know very little about cars, so I wouldn't be able to do much maintenance myself. Am I justified in feeling this way, or would a LaCrosse be just as expensive to maintain? If I simply can't get my wife to agree on the LaCrosse, what car would be the best compromise between our tastes? Is there a standout vehicle among those I listed? Something I should be considering, but haven't? Any feedback is appreciated!.

3209,David23717," I would consider a 2013-2016 Audi S4 or maybe a Chevy SS (not the Camaro, 4 door sedan). These are easily found around $30-35k. This generation( B8.5) of the Audi A4/S4 are known to be fairly reliable. Cost of upkeep on German cars are higher, but not as elevated as people seem to believe. Audi has actually made huge advancements in reliability lately &amp; are currently rated as the 3rd most reliable make by consumer reports.

3210,northwoods23," Thanks for the reply. I haven't really looked into used cars too much because my wife wants a new one. But I already see loads of used 2016 S4's with low mileage well within our budget. I think she'd go for something like that.. Audi is my favorite of the German makes. I'd definitely go in for a test drive at least. My biggest concerns with the German cars were what we could afford. Basically, I didn't want to buy a new CLA 250 just because it's a Mercedes and in our price range. It seems there's better value to be had in the segment. Same goes for A3, 3-series, etc. And then we'd have to take into account the cost of maintenance which I've always heard is high on German cars. I'm not trying to diss anyone with one of those cars- they're just not really for me.. But something like a used S4 or E-class would have both low price and more upscale style.. If my wife is open to it then it's surely something to consider.. I'm still a bit worried about maintenance costs though. How much more than something like a Buick would it be? For example if I needed a minor repair done on a Buick, how much more would the exact same repair be on an S4? Is frequency of repairs a concern with either of those brands, or are they relatively comparable?.

3218,bowfryfrenchtie," The Volkswagen Golf GTI Autobahn is a really good pick for a new hatchback. They start at around $35k-$40k I think. The Chevrolet Camaro 2SS is pretty sweet too. It starts at $45k I believe. It's more powerful than the GT Premium as well (the Mustang definitely sounds better though).

3252,IKnowNewCars," ""Hybrid"" and ""fun to drive"" are often mutually exclusive, especially if we're talking about traditional hybrids (rather than plug-in hybrids). Also, I can't think of any dedicated hybrid models that offer AWD (even the new Kia Niro cute ute/small crossover is FWD only). And many hybrid versions of gas vehicles don't actually improve fuel economy enough to make it worth the extra initial cost (especially when the driving experience is negatively influenced by the addition of a hybrid powertrain). All in all, you're gonna make some sacrifices here somewhere, but that doesn't mean there aren't some great options!. The Ioniq is my favorite traditional hybrid right now. Basically, it matches the fuel economy of the Prius, is a bit more fun to drive, and is a bit less expensive. It doesn't come with cooled seats, but not many hybrids in your price range offer that, to be honest. The SEL and Limited models are both fairly feature filled (don't bother with the Blue model's extra 3 MPG), and if you deck out the Limited model with the Ultimate package, you have an IIHS Top Safety Pick with lots of solid tech for $31k MSRP.. The Camry Hybrid's main draw here is the added interior space of a mid-size sedan vs a compact hatch like the Ioniq or Prius. You'll have to sit in each one to feel the difference for yourself, but if you want something the size of the Camry, the Hybrid SE model might be a great place to start. Still no ventilated seats, sadly.. I did find one hybrid option with ventilated seats:the new Accord Touring Hybrid. Its MPG should be about the same as the Camry Hybrid, with a spacious interior (though the back seat is a tad smaller due to its sloping roofline), and the Touring model has all the amenities you could want. One downside:the MSRP is just over your $35k budget limit, so you'll have to decide whether the added features are worth the jump in price.. Finally, if we look at AWD hybrids in your price range, things get a bit rough but they're out there. The Toyota Rav4 isn't my favorite crossover, but it does have a hybrid version with a decent MPG rating (32 combined), so it might be worth checking out. Surprisingly, the Honda CR-V gets an impressive 29 MPG combined with AWD using its 1.5L turbo non-hybrid engine, standard on all trims except the base LX trim. If you want a great, fuel efficient AWD vehicle in your price range, I suggest looking there (though ventilated seats aren't available on the CR-V)..

3257,IKnowNewCars," At this price range, it basically comes down to test driving. The Huracan is probably the best performing car for $200k, so if you want the craziest performance for the money, the Huracan will not let you down. But it has lots of great competitors:the Porsche 911 Turbo S, the Audi R8 V10 Plus, or the McLaren 570S (or 570GT, if you'd rather sacrifice a bit of power for a more comfortable long distance car).. If you decide you want to blend style and performance, your price tag will also get you a Ferrari Portofino, Aston Martin DB11, or Bentley Continental (there's also the Continental Speed, if you want crazy power with your grand tourer).  And if you wanna go all in on style in a luxury roadster, the Mercedes-AMG SL65 is timeless, gorgeous, and has a stupidly big twin-turbo V12..

3262,rkito118," BMW X3 is my daily driver and I absolutely love it, but I think the interiors from Mercedes and Audi are more comfortable and the MB is definitely more luxurious.. I think if a quiet comfortable driving experience is paramount than the Mercedes Benz GLC is my top pick followed by the Audi Q5, the new Volvo is also a contender. I like the X3 but the options add up in price quickly and the AWD is not as good as what Audi/Porsche and MB have on offer. The Maccan and X3 are the sportier of the bunch and might miss the mark for what you're looking for. Also Porsche is stingy with the standard equipment and the options list is long and pricey. Land Rovers are only for if your name is Elizabeth and you are staying at Balmoral. Its really only shines in its off road abilities compared to other luxury suv's.. The MB GLC replaces the old GLK. The GLK was a wannabe G Wagon all upright and boxy. The new GLC is a C class wagon on taller suspension. Its sleek and stylish, offering a quiet supple ride. Everything MB uses on the interior is quality, ergonomics are better than the model it replaces. Cabin noise is non intrusive. The 2018 model is available with the options you are looking for though remote start is only through a smartphone app which requires a yearly subscription to MB's M-Brace thing. I would expect that GLC to come out to around 50-53k MSRP with the options you want.. Also a good pick for you; the Audi Q5. All Audi's look alike but the 2018 model gets a much needed mid cycle refresh keep up with the upgraded offerings from its competitors. The Q5 now comes available with Audi's Virtual Cockpit instrument cluster. Basicly instead of the standard set of gauges you get a big ass customizable screen that even includes turn by turn navigation. Interior quality is top notch but IMO not quite as classy as MB. Quattro AWD is the best AWD system in luxury cars today. a Q5 prestige trim and comes with plethora options at 50k including remote start and Apple Carplay/Android Auto. Throw in the cold weather packages for heated seats and steering wheel for $500. The $1450 warm weather package ges you upgraded to sport seats with ventilation and rear window sunshades.. TL;DR:MB GLC is nicer inside and better looking. The Audi Q5 is better in the snow and gets you more bang for your buck. Go sit in both at the dealer and decide..

3264,rkito118," The Audi Q3 is smaller than the Q5 but still a solid pick. Its probably enough crossover for most peoples needs, and comes well equipped with a lower price than the Q5.. I actually like the NX, it puts Lexus in the same segment as the Q5 and GLC. Everything oozes Lexus quality and feels as good as it looks. The ride is quiet and calm, its no sports car but is never feels un confident. The styling is down to personal tastes. On the downside the interior feels a bit more cramped (cockpit like) than other cars in this segment. Also Toyota/Lexus infotainment is a hot mess and really makes living with this car a pain.. The RDX is...nice. Its not a bad car by any measure, but in a market with a semi-M X3 and the Alfa Stelvio, why buy the Acura. It feels and looks like a really nice CR-V with a somehow worse infotainment system than the Honda. A Honda CR-V Touring is a better deal to be frank. People will still buy it cause of Honda reliability/brand loyalty.. ",Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dwdn81m,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/878b8d/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
3265,PorcupineSpike," What do you mean by ""Semi M""?  You mean that the X3 engine is high performance what an M4 is to a 3 series BMW?

3266,rkito118," I'm referring to the X3 M40i. Its not a full on M sport model SUV like the X5 M but its got some suspension upgrades, bigger engine, and some of the M styling.. I think the X1 is still a valid option along with the new X2. Its a more compact package at a lower price, which is good considering the current X3 crests 50k with popular options.. I think that the Q3 is a little better than the X1 for most drivers. It doesn't handle as sharp as the X1, but the Q3 is a bit roomier inside and has more features for less money than the BMW. There is also the new X2 and I haven't driven one yet to see how that all fits in with the rest of the segment.. As far as X3/Q5 goes I think it really comes down to personal preference. The Q5 bests the X3 in features for money and AWD. The X3 is a sharper handling SUV and its available with an Inline 6 Turbo that makes 355 hp 369 ft-lbs.. With the exception of the M40i both the Q5 and the X3 are powered by a 2.0 turbo 4 that both make similar power and return similar mileage. They are both nice German cars with nice interiors and lots of features and tech..

3271,ArguablyTasty," Depending on your area, you could find an early FRS in that price range. Avid modding community, and low power, excellent handling is the perfect mantra for a first car for an enthusiast.. The reason you'll hear they lack power is because of a torque dip in the 3-4.5k RPM range. However, that's a non-issue if you . plan.  on modding, since it's fixed with headers + tune.. Otherwise, A4 will be much cheaper to maintain than E46, but G35 will be the cheapest. For AWD, I would go G35, A4, E46, WRX, in that order.

I really did enjoy the drive of the car, but the interior was about as bare bones as you could get. Cloth seats, dialpad, tiny little old screen. (and the RWD did not fair well in good ol' Florida rain). I am almost totally deadset on getting a Maxima, but my overthinking has started to get me to question my decision with people complaining about the depreciation, FWD, shitty infotainment center, and how large it is. I personally really enjoyed my test drives, loved the interior (really annoyed the 16 and 17 didn't have android auto), and the BIGGEST proponent is that we have a close family friend who owns a Nissan Dealership and is going to the manufacturer sale on April 4th, which could save me thousands on my Maxima. I could end up in a 2016 or 2017 SL Leathered and featured out Maxima in the low 20s.. I have been suggested to check out the BRZ/86 which I have always had my eyes on, but seems to be pretty tiny and with the automatic ""the 86 feels more like a small, loud, underpowered, cramped coupe and less like a budget sports car"" according to one reviewer which is how I felt when I sat in one, although didn't get a chance to test drive. I could be totally wrong.. I checked out the Hyundai Genesis Coupe (having owned a 2007 Hyundai Tiburon) and the driving honestly really didn't impress me. It felt very stiff, had decent handling, and not as much get up and go as I was expecting.. The Lexus RC350 looked sharp but is out of my price range, the ....Lexi? Lexuses? ones I could afford didn't really wow me.. I'm really not interested in a BMW, I've heard too many horror stories of repair costs. I was worried about the repair costs of Audi as well, the A3 seemed way too small for me, but the A4 has me intrigued. I didn't get a chance to test drive it, but it seems juuuust at the edge of my max for my budget with the miles. Also still worried about luxury repair costs.. I test drove a 2014 Infiniti Q50 and really enjoyed it, although enjoyed the Maxima better. The dual screen was a tad awkward, and I of course also worry about luxury costs of maintenance. Would love to get in a Q60S but out of my price range.. Am I being stupid with wanting to get something sporty and not just getting a reliable Honda or Toyota boring sedan? Or maybe a Sonata 2.0 sport or Civic Sport? Is the Nissan Maxima with a heavy discount a horrible idea or am I just overthinking? I'm 23, making decent money but I'm not like pushing $75k+.

3284,BoldTitan," I'm starting to have second thoughts on the Maxima...and mostly based on what other people are saying. That it's essentially a pseudo luxury car that isn't super sporty but has a decent engine. I worry about the redesign, and it being a popular rental car, and I've heard meh things about Nissan. I feel if I get a base model, I may as well buy an accord sport or similar....and if I get the SL trim...I may as well get a base line Audi A4 due to price.. Looking up the cost to own, the Maxima and Audi are somewhat similar! I was shocked!. Both cars I'd be looking at getting used with less than 25k miles...and I seem to keep finding them around $23-24k at local dealerships.. I just keep having people give me a confused look when I say I'm looking at a Maxima as a single 23 year old dude. As if it's too big, not sporty enough, and not the right fit.. The one thing keeping me really interested in the Maxima is the deal I may be able to get with the family friend who will certify my car, adding the warranty...and the worry or maintenance and repairs of an Audi I don't get from an Audi dealership (No used 2017s in the area...and if I'm getting an Audi, I want to have Android auto). It's hard to look at these basic 2017 and 2018 Honda and Toyota's that have these nice updated dashes and looks with Android Auto, and feel like I'm shelling out for a 2016 Maxima SL that can't even use it. And is approaching Audi price.. All that being said, maybe I'm just allowing other people to affect my buying decisions too much, as I did really really like my test drive of the Maxima....but maybe I'm not giving Honda and Toyota a fair shot just due to the stigma of them being cheap..

3289,IKnowNewCars," Comparing the GTI and WRX basically comes down to either FWD vs AWD or daily driver friendly vs performance oriented. The GTI is one of the best ways to balance fun, practicality, and comfort in its price range. Very refined for the price and a blast to drive. The WRX is a better performer, faster, more powerful, handles better, AWD traction, etc. But the WRX is also a less friendly daily driver:non-linear power delivery, harsh ride on rough roads, and a basic interior for the price. Oh, and if you want an auto, that's another point for the GTI, which comes with a great dual-clutch automatic that's still a ton of fun. The CVT in the WRX is just not that fun.. Something like the Mazda 6 would be ideal if you wanted more interior space and comfort, and would be willing to give up some performance to get it. When the new turbocharged Mazda 6 comes out in a few months, I assume you'll get it up in Canada too and that might be worth a test drive. The current 2.5L Mazda 6 is more fun on average than its direct competitors (1.5T Accord, 2.5L Camry, etc), but it's certainly not as sporty as a GTI. So that comparison is up to you! It might be worth checking out an Accord Sport 2.0T as well.. ",Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dwcuju7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/878b8d/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

There are two other cars I'd be willing to consider. The first being the . 2018 Mercedes C 300 Sedan.  ($52,840). , however, it's on the more expensive end (a little over my budget).

3296,rkito118," You seem set on MB. You've got some midsize sedans on this list next to come subcompacts. How much space do you really want? Seems like a compact like the C class would split the difference.. The CLA looks nice but you're really just paying for branding at that point. Compared to a Camry or Accord or even a C class its going to feel cramped, and it doesn't ride half as nice as a C class. And as you can see by your 44K build out you have to basically color in the options list to get a car representative of the badge.. The current C class is great and comes pretty well optioned out even in base form. If there is a new 2019 model coming than dealers may be looking to clear off the remainder of the 18's and you can look for a deal there. Don't sweat not getting the 2019. 45k spent on a C class is gonna feel nicer than 45k spend on a CLA.. Another option:Audi A4. As far as features for dollars goes in luxury cars, Audi is killing it. A A4 prestige (top trim) is 45,500 before options and comes with:heated seats, leather seats, sunroof, Bang Olufsen 16 speaker 755 watt sound system, heads up display, adaptive cruise control, 360 view camera, virtual cockpit instrument cluster, among other things. Add 4k for AWD. On the downside you may find that Audis look a bit dull compared to the C class.. EDIT:These prices are USD..

3300,InstantMoldyBred," I had a 2015 WRX and went to a 2018 GTI. For years I never even considered the GTI because on paper it looks like its not worth the trip to the dealership. Just give it a shot, ended up being everything I wanted. Think you'll see that the stats say one thing and your butt says another.. Also, got mine for 24k and the local dealer adds 10 years and 100k miles to the factory power train warranty. You read that right. 16 years and 172k miles.

3301,IKnowNewCars," Here's my way of looking at the WRX:It's the fastest you can go for $30k with 4 doors. It's also the best performer on the track in its price range, and AWD traction some dirt/rally capability too. It's a good time, especially if you opt for the WRX Premium w/ the Performance Package ($32k MSRP). But it has some low points for being a daily driver:power delivery is somewhat uneven (noticeable turbo lag), the manual transmission has long throws and isn't as sharp as some of its competitors, and the firm suspension that's responsible for its great handling also makes the ride quality on the harsh side. Figuring out whether or not it's right for you just comes down to a test drive.. The STi certainly isn't worth the money (in my opinion), since the performance gap between the WRX and STi has gotten smaller. So that leaves a couple of $35k performance hatches to compete against, and the one that best balances an awesome driving experience with being a great daily driver is the Civic Type R. Yes, it's FWD. But this car doesn't need a handicap to compete right up there with the Focus RS and Golf R. It's fast, it's trackable, it's comfortable, it's spacious, it's practical. It also looks kinda ridiculous, but that's entirely in the eye of the beholder. The other bummer is that you'll almost certainly have to pay MSRP if you want a Type R, since the demand for them is still high.. If you wanna stick with Japanese brands, you don't have many other things to choose from. The Civic Si is a great deal for $25k, again balancing sporty driving character and daily driver friendliness very well (and it handles crazy well for a $25k FWD sedan), but it's not gonna be as quick or capable as the WRX. You'll be saving about $5k though!. If you can look outside of Japan, it's worth looking at the GTI and the Focus ST too. Of course, if you can get away with only 2 doors, there's the Subaru BRZ. While you're at it, if you can get away with only 2 seats, just get a Miata and call it a day!.

3302,dxearner," From a 15 and 04 WRX owner, would add that while they have made strides to improve, Subaru interior quality is notoriously bad for rattles.. Many people buy these cars for the awd system and performance, but if you are commuting the car, it starts to wear on you that you paid north of 30k and car rattles worse than 10 year old cars. Granted there are threads on NASIOC where you can chase noises down, but honestly if you are going to commute this car everyday and not heavily modify, go with a GTI in my opinion.

3304,dxearner," It is my favorite body style, other than the 2012 wagon wide bodies . Overall, it is a great car, still going strong at 180k miles, but would recommend getting an STi in the same year set for a couple reasons: The added low end torque of the 2.5 is material. Alternatively, WRX's 06 and older (minus 2.0di motors starting in 15) have a 2.5 block, and it is nice to have if you are driving in traffic frequently.. While the WRX versions not as fragile as people make out, but the STi transmission is a nice piece of mind. Eventually, you'll want to mod and the 3k+ it takes to transplant one will weigh on your mind if you are going to a larger turbo than a small 16g. Trust me....you'll eventually want to mod the car.. Due to a slightly higher price point and beefer stock parts, you are more likely going to find a car in a better state, given how old the cars are at this point.. All that being said, not sure how tight finances are or how old, but insurance for an STi is materially higher than a WRX, so might be worth considering. Plus, obnoxious wing ;). Hope that helps..

3317,Ree4se, Toyota Camry XLE Buick Regal Sportback GS (my love) or drop the GS to save 10k still peppy Lincoln MKZ. What you‚Äôre already considering seems good too. I‚Äôm just giving options you haven‚Äôt scouted yet.. ,Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dwbhryi,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/878b8d/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
3318,QuintiusCincinnatus," Good choices. I really like Buicks. The current GS and the old Regal GS are awesome. Not sure if I could justify that much for a smaller sedan though. Especially without a turbo behind that V6. Something something nostalgia. Haha.. But yea, the last generation GS is definitely awesome if a manual one is to be found anywhere. I‚Äôm sure they are rare. I‚Äôll look more into the regular sportback. Only thing I don‚Äôt like is the idea of having two top trim GM cars. They‚Äôd be identical in terms of tech and similar in power. Kind of want diversity in my cars.. I have a thing for Lincoln. It sucked S a brand for so long. But the MM voiceover commercials have remade the brand in my eyes. The quality is excellent. I haven‚Äôt looked at the MKZ, but if it comes with the 2.7l turbo from fusion sport, in really interested. An intake and tune (about the only modding I do anymore) really wakes the ecoboost motors up. Same could be said for the current GM motors, as my cruze gains 59whp/96lb-ft just from a trifecta tune, iirc.. Also really like the new Acura TLX A-Spec in blue. I‚Äôm not a Honda guy, but between that TLX and the Si coupe, they‚Äôve been nailing their stuff lately. I used to deliver goods to one of the Honda plants. The cool factor is off the charts. I saw the TLX and RLX as testers before the general public. Couldn‚Äôt take pictures or discuss anything I saw until it was released, but o really liked the lines of that A-Spec as it hauled ass  down their racetrack..

3319,Ree4se, Interesting. I would say the Sportback is one of the biggest cars I‚Äôve seen (added 3 inches over last year I think). Maybe a bit shorter than the big boys but that hatch adds a ridiculous amount of room for storage. But I understand Buick is a bit weird with their price/luxury/sportiness triangle. I like where they sit to each their own. I understand the diversity argument. If I had two cars I would have a Regal and Miata or something.. The MKZ can fly. I was blown away by how much power was behind it when I test drove it.. I‚Äôm interested that you like the Acura. Those front ends trend me away in the beginning and the prices quickly go well and above my budget for the good stuff :. Good luck in your search.. ,Sub_Content, 2 months ago,t1_dwbhryi,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/878b8d/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

For the Legacy/Outback (you could get them as sedans &lt;2007ish), they're one of my favorite interiors of any car ever.  The interiors are simple, well built, and intuitive.  I had one while living deep in the Black Hills, and it was so much fun to carve up the mountain with.  The car is also fairly easy to maintain with a large online community able to help..

I was scared of that too, but by the end of the first week of owning my WRX I was already fairly good at it. Having someone with a manual car to practice on . would.  be nice, but definitely not a requirement. If you end up deciding to buy manual then watch some YouTube videos about sticks and then go take your new car to the nearest parking lot right after you buy it and practice before you drive home.

3416,BaronRaymondoEVIL," You already mentioned the perfect car. One of my all-time favorite vehicles, the Porsche Boxster (and its twin, the hardtop Cayman), is what you need. Yes, it‚Äôs a two seater, but there‚Äôs more trunk space than a 911 and the rear seats are useless in 911s anyway. Oh, and Boxsters offer way more bang for your buck. My wife daily drives hers. I owned mine for years a while back.. Make sure the car is a 2009 or newer. Engine reliability has been excellent since then.. If you must have an automatic, the 7-speed double clutch auto in the Boxster is among the best of the best. It shifts incredibly fast and it‚Äôll even telepathically downshift for corners when needed.. If you want even more performance, find an S model. They are truly fast in every category. In fact, when driving a 911 and a Boxster back-to-back, you‚Äôll be shocked to discover that they feel like almost the same car. If you don‚Äôt want a convertible, then the hardtop Cayman is also available..

I currently live in Colorado and my I just got out of an Audi S3 lease and into an SQ5 which I'm not taking to Hawaii. Since Hawaii is limited on space and there really aren't enough roads in general, I'm thinking that I really won't need a sportier vehicle and maybe something that sips gas less.. I partly want a crossover type vehicle for going to the beach but I wonder if I will even need my car to actually drive on sand. Not too fond of jeeps but I did consider them.. A Sportback would be nice but I'm concerned about just how long they are on a place with a horrible parking situation.. Lastly, Ive been looking at smaller vehicles and hybrids due to space concerns and gas mileage for the multiple traffic jams I'll be in.. Any advice?

3433,IKnowNewCars," I've spent time on O'ahu and Hawai'i (the Big Island), and I can't think of a time where driving on the sand as been necessary, or even an option for most folks. An AWD crossover probably won't be necessary to head to the beach there. If you do go the crossover route:the new BMW X2 does look nice, but I don't really get the X2/X4/X6 series, which are really just interesting-looking versions of their odd-numbered counterparts with smaller headroom in the back seat due to the sloping roof line. In the $50k range, you could squeeze into a Porsche Macan, or get more features (but a less exciting driving experience) from a BMW X3, Audi Q5, or Jaguar F-Pace. If you want something sportier, the Mercedes-AMG GLA45 would be an absolute blast if you can afford it, but the most features for your money in the luxury crossover realm would probably be found in a BMW X1, Lexus NX300 F Sport, or maybe the new Volvo XC40.. You might find the perfect balance between luxury, enjoyable driving, practicality, and capability with a luxury wagon of some sort. The Audi A4 Allroad runs 0-60 nearly as fast as the SQ5, it's even more nimble to drive, standard Quattro and increased ride height to handle most terrain and any weather, lots of storage space, and while it is on the long side, it may still be the compromise you're looking for. Other options include the Volvo V90 and BMW 330i Sports Wagon. If you want something a bit shorter, more fun to drive, but still just as practical, try a BMW 340i xDrive Gran Turismo, which includes a sportback design and a 4.7 second 0-60 time. The Audi A5/S5 Sportback and Kia Stinger GT are both fantastic too, so you'll just have to test drive these and see which fit the bill (and which ones are longer than others).. If you decide going smaller is important, a little sports car like an Audi TTS could be great, but I'd be more inclined to try something with a tiny bit more practicality. The BMW M240i is an incredible balance of all the things you're looking for, if you don't mind a 2-door car (you can even get it with xDrive if you want).. If you end up looking more seriously at fuel costs, I wouldn't bother with a dedicated traditional hybrid, like a Toyota Prius or Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid. The cost savings are there, but they're boring as sin to drive. A plug-in hybrid like a Chevy Volt or Audi A3 e-tron would give you real fuel cost savings, plus either of them can be decked out with nice interiors and lots of features (the Audi more so than the Chevy, though the Volt's electric-only range is MUCH better than the e-tron). For both of these, though, you'll have to have a place to charge them, and ideally you'll want a 240v charger installed in your garage. If you go that route, you should also consider all-electric options, like the Chevy Bolt, VW e-Golf, or BMW i3. The Tesla Model 3 may be feasible by the time you move, but there's absolutely not enough data yet to give it a serious recommendation..

Either a convenient audio system (aux in, iphone in, and bluetooth) or an easy to replace audio system so I can make it convenient. I listen to mostly podcasts and audio books, so speaker quality should do spoken voice clearly, but doesn't need to be too fancy. Something with great brakes and tires, that can stop on a wet, steep hill.. Preferred, not quite must haves:4 doors. Fuel efficient. Automatic parallel parking. Back up camera.

Once every other month weekend road trips.. Vehicles you've already considered:Not sure yet, it's a pain in the ass to search for cars by specific features, the automatic parallel parking stuff is what I really want to see where my options are.

I brought it in often for general maintenance stuff like new tires, wipers, break pads, belts, and oil changes. The only major repair was something went bad and the car was overheating. I took it into the shop and they fixed whatever that was.. I'm trying to figure out how actively I should be shopping for a new car versus keeping that car going. It's running OK right now, but I need some basic maintenance (new wipers, tires might be getting old, new tabs), and I figure instead of dumping a few hundred into it, I might be better off replacing it..

I know that the new Toyota Prius and Chevy Mallibu offer it but only on top trims that run over 30k.. A Honda Fit really does check all your other boxes and makes a fantastic city car. Also worth a look might be a new (2016 or newer) VW Golf, its a 4 door hatchback with good mileage and a short wheelbase that makes it a good candidate for city parking. Brakes are 4 wheel disc and very strong. The golf is also available with Android Auto or Apple Car Play which make smartphone integration with your infotainment system pretty much seamless.

Don't think her Pathfinder is gonna be able to hold that down at 230k miles.. My dad has a 2006 Chevy HHR with 250k miles he was going to sell us for cheap at $2100. Drives fantastic, new tires. But, I took it to a mechanic and 30 error codes popped up in the diagnostics. 36 before they changed out the spark plugs. They aren't very confident about HHRs making it much past 250k miles.. So, that's the situation I'm in.. ",Main_Content, 5 months ago,t1_ds6zjme,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7neoon/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

3471,IKnowNewCars," There are lots of used options, but I'm going to focus on new options, because that's what I'm good at. I have something in mind, I'm not sure if this will be your favorite choice, but I'd seriously consider it if I were in your shoes: 2018 Chevy Camaro V6. I'm usually a Mustang guy, but Chevy deserves props for making an affordable pony car with such a well-built chassis and all the right performance parts to go around it. Start with the V6 engine, pick the 1LS trim, add the RS package, and tack on the $900 Performance Exhaust option. The result is a $31k coupe that, and I'll quote Car &amp; Driver here, ""drives a lot like the BMW 3-series used to."" Great manual transmission, well-rounded V6 that sounds even better with the performance exhaust, 0-60 in 5.1 seconds, decently comfortable interior, spacious back seat for a coupe, surprisingly nimble driving experience, and certainly isn't too harsh to handle the rough roads between your house and the highway. $31k MSRP really means $30k after incentives, or $26-27k after dealer discounts and negotiating (American brands are slashing prices big these days on most models). A Mustang could work too if equipped properly (Mustang EcoBoost, Equipment Group 101A, Performance Package, and MagneRide suspension, comes out to almost $33k MSRP), but the Camaro offers the best driving experience for the money right now.. Having said all that:The Elantra GT Sport is great for the money, and it's certainly cheaper, so going that route would be a responsible choice. Hatchback body style is practical too. I love the 86 and BRZ, though I could see the ride quality being harsher than you'd hope for rough roads (plus the back seats are about as tiny as they get). I'm certainly a fan of the new 2018 Camry, but if you don't need the room in the back seat, I think you'd be much better off with a Mazda 3 5-door Grand Touring with a manual transmission. Similar or better practicality for your purposes with a more fun driving experience and even nicer interior (in my opinion).. But if you're in a position to go with a RWD car like a Camaro or Mustang, I think you'd be very happy going that route..

3472,Floatography," I will definitely go test drive a Camaro v6, I have heard they are great. I basically drive a proto turbo camaro right now so it might be very comfortable for me to switch to. As long as it can take on a bumpy road without disassembling my spine it is probably the right choice.. Funny thing is that I used to actually own a BRZ but I lived in a part of town with EXCELLENT roads so I really cant remember how it handled shitty roads. The backseat being useless for humans doesn't actually matter, it basically just needs to be able to hold 2 chihuahua sized dogs which it could do handily. When I owned the car it suited my lifestyle quite well. I only sold it because someone made me a really good offer for it and I had another car to drive around. I really need to just go to the closest toyota/subaru dealership to my house and ask if I can test drive the car to my driveway and back again and see how it handles the bad roads. If it is acceptable then it seems like the solution.. ",Sub_Content, 5 months ago,t1_ds31510,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7neoon/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
3473,IKnowNewCars," Two great choices. I haven't test driven every Camaro variant, but I've read the only one that's too harsh for daily driving duties is the Camaro ZL1 1LE, which is a bit above your price range anyway. Worse come to worse, you can opt for a V6 Camaro with 18"" wheels, but the 20"" wheels on the RS models look SO good it's hard to say no (plus they provide a bit sharper steering and handling, and the front grille and decklid spoiler look great).. Also, if you go with the BRZ, make sure you opt for the Limited with the new Performance Package. It's not expensive, the wheels look great, but most importantly the better brakes and new dampers give it some extra capability and credibility as a corner carving sports car. If you're not gonna have big power, you might as well have killer handling.. Good luck, and enjoy whichever car you pick!.

3483,scadler," I currently have a 2011 Ford Escape Hybrid and am looking to sell it while I can still get $5-10K for it and add that trade in value towards the value of a newer car instead of just running this one into the ground mileage wise. In my mind it's always better to have a car that is in good working order rather than go anywhere near having the concern of having one of those arm&amp;leg surprise expenses that can come from cars. I know there may be some conjecture on this but it's worked well for me in the past and generally speaking the largest maintenance expenses I have incurred in my 12 years driving have been replacing tires. I am mainly looking for advice in terms of what cars I haven't thought of yet. I bought the 2011 Ford EscapeHybrid in early 2013 and before that, a 2006 Ford Escape Hybrid in early 08, so I don't mind there being a bit of use/wear and tear when I buy it - but ideally there's less than 30k miles on it. The 2011 had 25k miles when purchased and it's around 85k now.. Location:Los Angeles, CA, USA. Price range:$20,000-$32,500.00. Lease or Buy:Prefer to buy but willing to look at leasing?. New or used:Either, likely used. Type of vehicle:Hybrid SUV. Must haves:fuel efficient + trunk space + cruise control + decent in car stereo etc(I think most cars come with all this stuff nowadays). Desired transmission (auto/manual, etc):automatic/hybrid. Intended use:daily driver + weekend car for mountain/desert trips(I use the racks on top and I want an SUV that can easily handle a bit of ice and snow. I use the trunk space enough times for furniture and other object moving throughout the year that I would rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it.. Vehicles you've already considered:Nissan Rogue(need to go do a test drive and really look at the trunk spacing), Lexus NX 300h(great car but am concerned about maintenance costs). Is this your 1st vehicle:This is my third vehicle. Do you need a Warranty:can go either way on this. Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: anything beyond changing a battery/wiper blades/headlights and i'm en route to a real mechanic. Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:no. Additional Notes:I bought my current car in the middle of nowhere Mississippi(I was living in Kentucky at the time) and I got it for a GREAT price due to them having had it on their lot for 10 months(no one in MS wants/cares for a hybrid), and me walking in there with cash and ready to walk out that very day. I guess what I'm saying is I have no problem with, and almost prefer to, finding a car that is out in the sticks versus in the city to get the price I want..

3507,CTR_Challenger," '18 Jaguar XF 3.0L Supercharged V6 or 18' Volvo S90 T8?. My Uncle is considering these two for his next vehicle and I find it to be a tough choice. Reliability doesn't really matter to him because he has another vehicle and will be doing a 3 year lease. He hasn't yet looked at the Jaguar, but he has test driven the Volvo and found there to be a major lag in power because its a turbo + supercharged 4-Cylinder. The reason he is more compelled towards the Jag is because there should be more instantaneous power and he prefers the sportier look. What do you think?.

3508,IKnowNewCars," I'm confused. The S90 T8 is a plug-in hybrid with 400 HP, notably great throttle response from the electric motors and a 4.5 second 0-60 time. Is it possible he test drove the T6 instead? I do love the refinement, power delivery, and exhaust note of the Jaguar XF S powertrain, but the S90 T8 is undeniably faster, and when in the correct drive mode (try ""Power"" for example), lag should be nonexistent.. Having said all that, for 2017 the XF came with an optional 35t powertrain, which was a 340 HP detuned version of the 380 HP supercharged V6 in the XF S. It had nearly the same performance at a big cost savings, which made it very worth the money to me. If you're looking up in that price range, I think the S90 T8 is probably the better bet. But you've gotta make sure he likes the way it drives. If he's looking in the $65k range and wants something with great engine performance, there are plenty of other options to consider (the Genesis G80 Sport comes to mind, or maybe the Audi A6 3.0T, Mercedes-Benz E400, or Cadillac CTS V-Sport)..

3513,IKnowNewCars," One of the first steps will be figuring out how much interior space you're willing to pay for. That's the primary difference between compacts (Civic/Corolla) and mid-size/family sedans (Accord/Altima), and it mostly manifests itself in back seat room and trunk space. A family sedan, like the name suggests, will be easiest to have room for car seats and stuff for the kids, but for some folks who only plan on having one kid (or just one to start, until they get a bigger car), a compact may work fine. And either way, if you're gonna have kids in the car, safety should be a priority.. If you go the compact route, you'll have to choose between a hatchback (which will offer more flexible cargo space for added practicality) and a sedan (which will have a traditional trunk and sometimes other benefits): The Honda Civic is my favorite in this class right now. The new hatchback body style is very practical and very enjoyable to drive. I would try out the EX-L Navi trim, which has a nice leather interior and built-in navigation, and add Honda Sensing, a top-rated active safety system that also includes adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping. The price tag comes out below $28k, it hits all of your desired points, and is super fuel efficient at 31/40 MPG (city/highway). The Civic Sedan in Touring trim is the same price with nearly identical features, but gets a trunk instead of a hatchback, plus a slight boost to 32/42 MPG.. The Civic is very safe, though IIHS gives its headlights a rating of Poor, meaning it's not the #1 safest compact on the market. Sadly, finding a car in your price range that's spacious enough for kids, includes built-in navigation, is an IIHS Top Safety Pick, and gets over 30 city MPG is very difficult. I'm gonna say the Civic is your best bet!. ",Sub_Content, 5 months ago,t1_ds549iq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7neoon/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

3533,Author_Name_deleted," I‚Äôm currently looking at these three cars if my current car (06 Altima) ends up being totaled: 2014-2015 BMW 328i with roughly 40k miles. I‚Äôve always wanted a BMW, but the warnings about maintenance costs have really scared me away (I know very little about cars, so buying the parts and doing fixes on my own is out of the question.. 2016/2017 Mazda6:this car looks really, really nice, but I don‚Äôt know a lot about Mazda. Is there a catch here? Is has all the features of the BMW, yet for the same cost (or a tad cheaper), I can get one with under 25k miles or even new if I go a little higher. Is there a specific trim I should be considering or staying away from?. 2017/2018 VW Passat:my wife owns a 2014 Jetta and I love it. We had a Passat for a rental once and it seemed really nice, but I cannot recall the year (2015 maybe?). One of the bigger appeals here is that I could get a brand new car with a warranty and knowledge that I know . exactly.  how it‚Äôs been driven/maintained for the same price as the BMW with 40k or a slightly used, higher trim Mazda6. I believe a new, basic trim Mazda6 is roughly equivalent in price to a new Passat, but I need to learn more about Mazda‚Äôs trims because it feels like there are a million.. I realize the BMW is a luxury car and will feel and drive better than the others, but I‚Äôm also coming from a basic car that is 12 years old, so I‚Äôm certain . any.  car will be a huge upgrade (my Altima doesn‚Äôt even have an aux port, let alone Bluetooth). My current plan is to test drive the cheapest one first, and if I fall in love then I won‚Äôt even bother driving the others so I‚Äôll never know what I‚Äôm missing. Since the Mazda and Passat‚Äôs are roughly the same price, I‚Äôm really looking for information regarding the differences between the two, or if there‚Äôs anything else I should be considering. Any input?. ",Main_Content, 5 months ago,t1_ds5x6e1,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7neoon/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
3534,rkito118," Out of those 3 I would buy the Mazda 6.. On the 328 you may want to look into getting a Certified Pre-Owned they usually come with some sort of limited warranty and they are are cars with complete maintenance histories. Today's BMWs aren't the quite the garage queens that people make them out to be. But they don't tolerate neglect, you've got to stick to the maintenance schedule and the maintenance isn't cheap. The 3 series is a smaller car than the midsize Mazda6 or the Passat, if you have car seats or frequent rear seat passengers you may want to take that into consideration. BMW's have no set 'trims' so the options can vary from car to car. I have a 17' X3 and IMO the Navigation system with iDrive is worth the extra cost, its a great system.. The Mazda 6 is another good pick. Its a looker and its finished nicely as well, not as good as the BMW, but better than what other non-luxury makers are offering. Like all Mazda's handling and steering response is as good as it gets for a FWD car. You'll get better mileage, lower maintenance costs and better resale over the BMW (BMW's depreciate very fast). The Mazda comes with only one engine option a 2.5L I4 making 184hp I think for most recent Mazda's the trims are Sport, Touring, Grand Touring with the former being the base model and Grand Touring being top of the line. New Mazda's sport a control knob in the center console a-la BMW's iDrive, its actually quite good. Most Mazda options are packaged in the trim levels so you kinda know what options you're getting in a given trim. The middle trim is pretty well optioned with some things you wouldn't  expect to find at that price point. The cons on the Mazda are that its louder with more road and wind noise intruding into the cabin, weight cutting measures are evident in the lack of sound insulating materials. The ride has improved greatly over the last 2 generations but is still a bit stiffer than other cars in its class. If youre willing to put up with a little more noise this is a great pick.. The Passat gets an ""eh"" from me. The new VW products coming out on their new MQB platform are a good return to form for VW (See; the new Golf and Tiguan). The 18' Passat is still rolling along on the old platform and will probably see a model refresh in the next couple years on the new platform. It is by and far the biggest of the three, the Passat is technically a mid-size car per the EPA, but it feels roomier than a lot of full size sedans inside. Handling wise the Passat is no slouch but its ceritanly the tamest of the three. The VW comes with two options; a 1.8 I4 turbo and a 3.6 V6 making 170 and 280 hp respectively. The 4 is not quite enough and the 6 is just a bit too much (costwise). VW trims are pretty simple S, SE, SEL from bottom to top, you'll pay more for comparable options on the VW than the Mazda but it is worth noting that te Passat supports smartphone integration where BMW and Mazda do not.. I say; drive a Mazda 6 and a 328 back to back and see if its worth the extra cost to you..

3559,Xaendeau," In general, if you can get a certified pre-owned vehicle, they will last you a while.  They come with 100k warranties on the power train.  Alternatively, to safely buy used, you should take the cars to a mechanic (independent of where you are buying it) and ask them to look at it for you.  You can give them like $50 and they can get it on a lift and fully check the car out for you.  This is always the best advice when looking for a used car.  As for the cars themselves: The WRX is fun, not as quick as the others, but can be found 5-10k under your budget if you don't pick the STI.  Very good value and this would actually be the financially smart pick.  They just always hold resale, Subaru owners are a cult or something.. Golf R in Manual, Focus RS are in similar categories.  Golf R is more refined and has a nicer interior, Focus RS is a bit more raw and has a bit more power (tad heavier too).  Both are fantastic cars that are very tunable.  From the owners I've talked to, they say the cars just feel special when they drive (and AWD to boot!).. GTI is what I'd recommend if your price range was a little bit lower (better than a FoST) but compared to a lot of the cars you are cross shopping, it just isn't that special.  A lot like the Golf R, but with less power and less traction (FWD).  I'd put this as a 2nd place smart financial choice, behind the WRX.. Avoid the FoST, since you can get cars so much better because of your price range.  They . are.  fun hatches, but they are more of raw power at the cheapest price.  This is about two price tiers lower than what you should be looking at.  I've seen them go for like 17-19k, so you can probably do better.  My personal car is a FiST that I'm swapping out the turbo.  I got mine for 14.5k and dropped 3.5k in parts over a year (intercooler, radiator, turbo, exhaust, tuning).  330 HP and 2600lbs is a blast, but I wanted cheap and fast...and it outruns most of these cars.  However, taking a project like this is a bit much if you aren't too mechanically inclined.  The Fiesta just handles so much better...and now it is actually very fast.. Adding power is easy, changing handling isn't.  That is why I would not recommend getting a newer BRZ/FRS or a FiST.  If you plan on getting turbo/supercharger kits or toyed with the idea of tuning cars, these guys rock for serious power adders. Turbo swapping a Fiesta or Supercharging a BRZ is something special.  Lightweight and wicked fun.  These kind of projects you remember for a lifetime, but are hard to do if you aren't young and have 2.5 kids and a dog in the suburbs.  If you ever wanted to do something like that, this would be the time.. I'd stay away from the Corvettes, they are dirt-nasty low...so not a winter car at all.  370z are yesterday's performance car.  If Nissan did a new model (390z? :), I'd look at that but the current ones aren't that great.  If you can get a certified pre-owned Porsche, that would be fun.  However, I would not buy a used one that isn't a CPO.  V8 Mustang is always a standard but too.. I would test drive all of these vehicles when the weather warms up.  I drove 20 cars before setting on mine.  Find one that feels special to you!.

Additional Notes:My wife has a fairly lengthy commute and is looking to upgrade to a smaller suv/crossover after she's driven the G35x into the ground a bit.. I've noticed that 2018 is a new frame for the Q5 which means that 2017/16 are potentially cheaper but will not have the features of a brand new new car. RDX Acuras I feel like are a mixed bag and most research I've done rates them fairly reliable (which is important to me), albeit not exciting internally. RX350 lexus just rebadged too recently, but used wise aren't much cheaper than new cars, and potentially just out of our budget. I'm leaning towards a 2016/17 Q5 right now with the understanding that we'll have to baby it through maintenance and european cars sometimes end up costing you an arm around that 100k mileage mark. Would we need to get a CPO Q5 to get a waranty through a dealership? My uncle works at a pre-owned dealership and has a variety of cars at slightly below market rate, but nothing would be CPO'd..

I've driven both and while the GTI is quick and nice on the inside...if you really want to keep this car 10 years, the Honda is the answer for cheap repairs and reliability.. The engine in the Si is the same as ALL of the rest of their 1.5T lineup, it just has a turbo with a better compressor wheel for more power.

Pre-2009, it was available only as a 2.0-litre/143bhp 4-cylinder petrol. | There's also a 3.3-litre/232bhp V6, sold only in CDX+ trim, which is rare, and although good to drive, very thirsty and expensive to run. | Style replaced CDX in April 2009, from July 2006 to April 2009 all turbodiesels were badged 2.0 CDX. | There's no major reliability issues to worry about with a Sonata, but watch out for ex-taxis on the market with high mileages, clocking (winding back the mileometer). | Heavy deprecation means you're getting a good bargain..

Lexus GS 350 (only about 300hp, but of course lexus quality but probably least sporty). Infiniti Q50 3.0t/3.7 (300hp or so, Red Sport has 400hp but more expensive). 2014/2015 Audi S4 (great value at 25-30k, great looks and pretty fast at 330hp and 0-60 in low 5s, out of warranty repair/maintenance may be concern as it is an audi though recent audis have had better rep for reliability). ~2013 Audi S6 (4.0L TT with 400hp, bit bigger, likely higher miles than the S4 but again may be more expensive ti maintain with it being older and an out of warranty german car....).

Must haves:-reliable (at least relatively, or cheap to fix works too)!!! -Also it can't break or engine blow if I rev it up or drive spiritedly (cough my previous budget car cough). I won't drive spiritedly excessively. -Preferably a strong engine as it is quite cold where I am and engine will see wear quick. -As long as it doesn't have horrendous gas milage. Currently my Porsche has on average 12 litres per 100km (city). If I drive it hard, it goes to 15 litres per 100km So preferably lower than this or around this. As long as it's not ridiculously bad. -I do not mind AWD, read my intended use and you will understand!. average insurance cost, or at least not a High one.. Desired transmission:Manual, unless it is at the cost of reliability. Intended use:I want a cheap sport car that I don't care Much about and can track once in a blue moon without having to worry about the $20,000 dollar paint or god knows much it is for a new Porsche. I will also drive it in winter, so preferably a balanced car. I have experience driving RWD in winter, been driving sports cars since the beginning. Never looked back. That isn't a problem. However I wouldn't mind AWD if a car with AWD fits I'm more than happy to be a bit safer than sorry (there are days where I won't drive due to black ice, an AWD car could enable those days I suppose).. Vehicles I have already considered: Honda S200, because it has a engine designed for high revving and naturally aspirated, probably won't blow if I drive spiritedly on track for a few laps (I do not track often at all, maybe twice a year) Decent fuel economy (especially when compared to the Porsche I would hope), and sounds like it could be a reliable car.. GT86 or BRZ or FRS. Same theory as the S2000. In this case Subaru definitely do not make as good as a naturally high revving engine. But it's a much newer car for around same price. It's just a matter of which 9je being more reliable. s2000 aluminum engine technology seems like even though it is many times older, but could be potentially still more reliable? Then again I don't know what other issues aside from engine it could have that the 86 twins likely will not.. -hyundai Genesis coupe, 2013 or newer. Mostly the 2.0t, I may go up to the 3.8 depending on which one is more reliable. But Hyundai just DOESNT seem like a reliable brand to me at all so I m not sure if both of these cars are a good idea. My friends had a few Genesis coupe brand new. Two of theirs blew, and one had transmission issues. They also had to constantly visit the dealership. So maybe not a good idea.... -maybe a Chevy Camaro or a mustang? Again no clue on reliability, I would assume it's trash. But maybe low cost to fix? Never had a pony car, might be cool to own one, as long as it won't be a headache and don't blow if I track it a few laps during a year.. used Audi TT, S4 that are roughly under 20. at least has AWD. Which would be cool during winter. But Audi maintenances are high I would assume? Probably not a good choice?. I think ultimately it seems like S2000 and 86 twins are most reliable? Let me know of any other options or your opinions on the ones listed!. DO I NEED A WARRANRY:do I? I don't know.... Not my first vehicle.. Cannot work on my own vehicle minor or major.

3623,Xaendeau," As a recommendation, I would bring any car you are thinking about buying to an independent mechanic in your area and give them like $40 to check the car out for you before you sign anything.  This is the best advice I can give if you don't have a better idea of whatcha looking for.  Ask them if they know any particular issues on what you are buying.. As a general recomendation, stay away from older gen VWs (EA888 gen3 engines are great, '15+ older VW stuff is notorious.)  German stuff is expensive to repair too, so BMW and Mercedes is out.. The FCA group have very inconsistent build quality in their cars.  Stay away.. Stay away from automatic Ford Focus' and Fiestas.. Early Nissian/Infinity CVTs transimissions had issues. Took them a few years to sort everything out.. Chevy has some a few good cars, but many comact cars with horrible issues from acquisition of Daewoo (FCA of Korea).. Newer Kia/Hyundais are great, anything older than 2012-2014 is a crapshoot...but hey, the new ones have excellent warranties.. Honda and Toyota are standard choices too.  Acura/Lexus are just pretty Hondas/Toyotas, they generally drive about the same as the cheaper version, though this is recently starting to change..

3626,jetiger," It sounds like you don't know what kind of car you want yet, so it's hard to help you. My recommendation would be to go out and test drive some different vehicles and see what you like. Try an FRS/BRZ for a chuckable car, try out a mustang, try a civic si, and all the other types of cars you're interested in. Once you know the type of car you want, it'll be easier for us to help you..

You are working with 8k.  You could accidentally buy a money pit.. G35 is `ight, pretty standard buy.  The sporier G series models are a bit more special.  Mazdaspeed6s are a BLAST :, but a bit heavy.  Still great car if you find one with low miles, good sleeper when tuned up.  Non-turbo Subaru have had head-gasket issues, but the turbo ones with more power are a bit more reliable (weird, yeah?).. Lexus cars are fun, but oftentimes they still remind you of Toyota when you turn.  Older ones are a bit better in this regard..

3674,IKnowNewCars," First thing's first:I'd avoid the CLA. It's not a bad car per se, but if you can afford a C-class, A4, 3-series, etc, it's just not worth it. If you wanna save money by going with a smaller vehicle, the Audi A3 Quattro is a great way to go, but I'll focus here on compact executive cars (a fancy name for these entry-luxury sedans). By the way, I'm from the US, so some names and packages could be slightly different in Canada.. If you're looking for something more luxurious, smooth, and comfortable than sporty, the C-class may be the way to go. Mercedes has done a great job taking some of the nice looks and luxury appointments from the E-class and S-class and packaging them into the smaller C-class. The back seat is on the small side, but other than that it should fit the bill nicely. No packages or options are necessary on a C300 to have a great luxury car, as even the base MX-Tex upholstery is a great substitute for real leather, but lots of people do add Smartphone Integration (for Apple Carplay/Android Auto) and Driver Assistance (Mercedes has some of the best active safety/autonomous driving features on the market).. Audi does a very nice job balancing luxury and sport, and with Quattro AWD coming standard on the better powertrain in the A4, you don't have to pay extra for its great drivetrain. The Premium Plus trim is worth the cash, for the additional features as well as the nice-looking 18"" wheels, but even in base Premium trim, the A4 Quattro is well worth the price, with standard leather, heated front seats, and sunroof. Comparing it to the C300 will require a test drive or two!. The next question is whether to consider the A5 Sportback vs the A4. Here's the answer:Start with the A4, add $2000 to the price tag for a comparably-equipped A5 Sportback, gain a practical hatchback cargo area instead of a trunk, make the back seat a bit smaller, gain some more nimble handling, but lose a little speed due to the Sportback's added weight. And of course, most agree it looks cooler than the A4. Other than those differences, it shares the same benefits as the A4, so choosing between them is entirely up to you based on your priorities.. I'd skip BMW if you're not really concerned with a sporty driving experience. Audi offers a solid amount of driving engagement, but BMW takes it a step farther with some sportier suspension options and standard RWD. If we're just talking about luxury and a smooth ride, they're not the best in the world right now. I'm a fan of the Jaguar XE, but since they did away with the 35t powertrain for 2018 and replaced it with the 30t (at least in the US), it's become more difficult to recommend. An XE 30t Premium or Prestige would be a nice way to balance a lovely interior with a pleasant driving experience, but it has some quirks that make it less desirable than other options on the market for a similar price.. In other words, I suggest test driving a C300 and an A4/A5, then sleep on it and see which you like better for the money!. ",Sub_Content, 5 months ago,t1_dsr79xr,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7qj2g8/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
3675,IKnowNewCars," The X3 and Q5 are both solid options for luxury crossovers in that price range. The X3 was redesigned for 2018, and while even the base model X3 30i does a nice job, it's really more worth it to step up to the X3 M40i, which has an awesome turbo-6 engine, but might be too expensive.. For someone wanting a balance of luxury and engaging driving, the Q5 is my recommendation. Every trim level is worth its price tag, depending on which features you want, and the 250 HP turbo-4 has more easily-available torque than the base X3, making it a better choice for the price (in my opinion).. Other options at a similar price point include the Jaguar F-Pace, which is nice, spacious, and worth a look as well. The Range Rover Velar is a bit on the expensive side, and its driving experience isn't as nice as others in its price range, but it's gorgeous, luxurious, comfortable, spacious, and great off-road. And of course, there's the Porsche Macan, which really is the Porsche of the crossover world, feeling lovely and sporty to drive in any configuration (some more so than others, of course)..

3682,IKnowNewCars," This is gonna be a weird suggestion, but hear me out:Kia Soul! The top level ! (Exclaim) trim comes with an awesome 200 HP turbo-4 engine and 7-speed dual-clutch transmission that runs 0-60 in 6.5 seconds. It's small and nimble enough to give a surprisingly enjoyable driving experience, but spacious enough to carry a good amount of stuff. The interior is really comfortable, with standard leather seats on the ! trim, and you can deck it out with the Technology and Sunroof packages while staying well in your budget range.. If the Soul is still too small, it might also be worth checking out the Subaru Forester XT. Its turbocharged 2.0L flat-4 (""just like a Porsche Cayman,"" you can tell your friends) has 250 HP and propels the XT from 0-60 in 6.3 seconds, and the cargo hold is big next to all its competitors (except the Honda CR-V).

As long as you don't get it in red, the exterior of the Exclaim looks a little more mature than the other trims (in my opinion), and the leather interior definitely helps. The Forester is definitely a more mature crossover, it's just quite a bit more expensive. Let me know how you like both of them, and if you have other ideas I can help you narrow it down!.

3703,IKnowNewCars," The BMW X1 is still the best enthusiast choice for a small luxury crossover, in my opinion. The engine and transmission are great, the chassis is nimble and balanced, and an M Sport model stays in your budget.. Other solid options include the Mercedes-Benz GLA250, which is a bit cheaper than the X1 to get with the Sport/AMG Line package and is just as enjoyable to drive, if not more so. But its back seat and cargo area are certainly smaller than the BMW, so you'll have to figure out which side of that balance you want to be on.. The E-Pace starts at $40k, and that's with the base engine and no additional performance options. Initial reviews seem to indicate an enjoyable driving experience, but it'll be hard to say whether it will live up to an enthusiast's expectations in base form, especially next to the X1 and GLA. The Range Rover Evoque is even more expensive, and while it does have a nimble chassis and a gorgeous interior (and exterior), its body style makes for a small back seat and cargo area, plus the ride quality is harsher than it needs to be. (Also, despite having more power than the BMW and Benz, it's slower than both.).

3724,IKnowNewCars," If the BRZ/86 has enough practicality for your purposes (two doors, very small back seat, fairly small trunk), then I definitely recommend it. The WRX is a great car, but it's a little rough as a daily driver (firm suspension, turbo lag, etc), and we don't know what the redesign is gonna bring. The BRZ/86 is one of those cars that is an absolute blast to push to the limit, it's lightweight, great steering and handling, and RWD means you get to take advantage of some antics the WRX would be too planted to the ground for.. Is there anything in particular the BRZ/86 would be missing that you'd want?.

And don't worry about the lack of power. As the old saying goes, it's a lot more fun to drive a slow car fast than a fast car slow. The BRZ isn't even slow, per se. It just means you'll be able to hit the redline more often when driving fast on curvy roads. It'll be a blast..

3755,Dan_E26," Hey all! I was initially looking for a pickup, but given my price range, it's extremely hard to find a nice truck that isn't old or beaten to hell. I've decided instead to get a hatch, cause I'm a college kid and it'll do fine enough until I'm out of college and I can afford the truck I really want (F150 Lariat). After discussing with my dad, I'm looking at the Focus hatchback, or a mazda 3/speed3 hatch. This will be the first car I buy myself; in high school I drove a plain old 09 Mazda 3 with the 4 speed autothat my parents got for REALLY cheap. I was never happy with the way the car drove on the highway and when the time came for either myself or my sister to keep the car for good, I let her take it, allowing me to get the car I really want some day.. Do you think its a bad idea to get a manual as my first car? The fuel economy, more control over the performance, theft deterrence, and let's be honest, the cool factor are all drawing me towards it. Surprisingly, my father agrees and thinks a manual would add a lot of fun to an otherwise plain car.. TLDR:first car is either gonna be a Focus hatchback or a Mazda3 hatch. Bad idea to get a manual?.

3758,galendiettinger," Focus:looks and feels cheap inside. Automatic transmission is so bad, people who bought them sued Ford for knowingly selling them shit.. If it's between these 2, get a Mazda. Bear in mind the Golf is in the same price range and is generally considered the gold standard for hatchbacks.. About manual:if you're looking for manual the Ford becomes an option since it's only the automatic tranny that sucks. Selling it will be hard since few people drive stick, but if you're keeping it until it dies then it doesn't matter..

Must haves:Comfortable for 2, sporty, around 200hp, reasonably efficient. Desired transmission (auto/manual, etc):Manual. Intended use:Fun daily driver. Vehicles you've already considered: Civic SI. Accord. Veloster Turbo. Mazda3 Sport. Is this your 1st vehicle:No. Do you need a Warranty:No. Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:Yes. Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:Yes, I'm a tech and have some access to my shop for personal work.. Additional Notes: Currently driving a first-gen Mazda6 with the 4 cylinder engine, it's becoming dated and the rust/paint problems are starting to build up. Engine runs fine, not in a rush to replace it. I have started in a secure career path and am getting ready to buy that I enjoy more.. I really like the Civic SI. It's the most powerful and has great creature comforts. The 2013 model year can be found listed mostly above my budget here. I am avoiding the 2012 year, but the 2010 and 2011 years are cheaper options.. The Accord is my second-choice to the Civic SI. The engine is similar to the SI, but less powerful. It's a more inconspicuous daily driver and still makes a decent enough sound and is a quick enough car. I would be looking at the 2010 model year, which is my favourite look for the car.. I have also considered the 2014 Mazda3 Sport. It looks nice and has really great creature comforts, but is more expensive and a lot less powerful than the other cars. On the flip side it's more economical as well, and I think owners enjoy it in the manual transmission regardless of the lower HP figure..

3764,runninthrutha6," I'll second the Mazda 3. You could get a hatch with very low miles near the top of your budget, or a low-mile sedan around 11k. Avoid the GX model, the GS model is fine and the GT is even better (probably won't find one in your budget though).. As far as I know, no big changes have been made from 2013-present, so don't worry about the year as long as it's 3rd gen.. As for the HP, it is lower but they are surprisingly agile for a ""normal"" compact, and they can be great on gas. I highlysuggest you test drive one!. Lastly, I'd cross the Veloster off your list. They look pretty cool, but I crossed shopped them before I got my 3 and they're super sluggish with a meh interior..

I think that a GS is realistic for me, the GT probably less so. Too bad about the Veloster, did you try the Turbo model? I agree the interior kind of sucks. It‚Äôs a car I really wanted to like.. Sounds more and more like the Mazda3 is a solid choice, not just for me but for compact sedans in general these days..

It has a flat 4, 200 hp, not expensive at all especially used so it should fit in your price range.

3776,IKnowNewCars," If you're going for a 2017 model, definitely swing towards the Accord. Both the Camry and Accord were redesigned for 2018, and even the Camry was improved to the point where I'm happy recommending it for 2018. But when comparing the previous generation of each model, the 2017 Accord is definitely the winner. You can't really go wrong.. If you go with a 2018 model, I recommend either the Camry SE or the Accord Sport. You can test drive both and see which dealerships will offer you a better deal in terms of out-the-door price and interest rates.. (By the way:If you go with the Accord, try and convince your parents to let you get a manual transmission. It'll be more fun to drive, and your future self will thank you for forcing yourself to learn while you're young. But the automatics in both the Accord and Camry are solid too.).

3778,IKnowNewCars," If you'd really have to pay $5-10k more for a 2018 Accord as opposed to a comparably-configured 2017 model, then it's probably not worth it. Personally, I'd be very tempted to get a 2018 Accord Sport with a manual transmission, simply because it pairs so well with the new turbocharged engines. But a 2017 model would be nearly as enjoyable and just as practical for less money, so that's probably the smart way to go.. On the Camry side, I'd still say no to a 2017 model. But that's just me.

3793,IKnowNewCars," Sporty and practical is very easy to come by nowadays, especially in your price range. So here's what you should ask yourself: You want a car with a back seat. Does that back seat need to be spacious enough to drive people frequently? If so, would they be kids or adults? Or would you just need it to store stuff when you're driving to work/school/the store?. What are your cargo needs? Will a small trunk be OK? Would a big trunk be necessary? Would a hatchback be helpful so you can fold down the back seats and move bigger things?. How much of a hassle would it be to have 2 doors instead of 4?. Are you willing to put up with more expensive repairs to buy a BMW or Ford over a Toyota or Honda? Are you willing to risk buying an Alfa Romeo that may need frequent trips to the dealership? Or would you rather give up a bit of sporty/refined driving for something more reliable? (Keep in mind that some cars are both reliable . and.  sporty. But you should pick which way you'd rather lean, to give us a better idea of what direction to point you in.).

3796,IKnowNewCars," The key with buying an SUV or crossover is to get one that isn't bigger than you need. It makes more sense to buy a smaller one that drives better, gets better gas mileage, and offers more features for the money, rather than buy one that's bigger than you need. So let's dive a bit deeper: Would you like a third row of seats? If so, how often will it be used? Will adults be using it, or mostly kids?. How much cargo space do you need? Will you need a lot of cargo space, even when all 3 rows are in use?. What sort of AWD capabilities do you need? Do you just need to navigate bad weather, or will you need to go off-road (or even farther)?. Will you need to tow anything?. Is there anything else you want or need in an SUV/crossover?.

3799,IKnowNewCars," I have some great suggestions then!. Mazda CX-9..  This is my favorite mid-size crossover on the market right now (if we don't count luxury brands). It's not right for everyone, since it's a bit smaller than its competitors, its cargo hold isn't massive, and its third row is on the small side. But it more than makes up for it as the mid-size crossover with the best driving dynamics, bar none. It's just a pleasure to drive. It's also very fuel efficient, has a nice interior, reliability is high, and the seating position is on par with the Acadia. The optional AWD system should handle most bad weather situations just fine.. Kia Sorento..  Another in-between model (optional third row, but not as big as a Pilot or Highlander), the Sorento is very comfortable and capable at a great price. It's not as fun or sporty as the Mazda, but its AWD system is a step above, meaning it might be even better at handling bad weather. Seating height is a tiny bit higher than the Mazda, but with a lower step-in height to make it easier to get in and out. Kia's warranty is top notch, and their reliability is near the top these days as well. Make sure you get the V6 engine, as it makes a big difference for everyday driving to have accessible power. The third row is optional, but if you get it and don't need it, you can keep it folded down, no problem. One weak point for the Sorento is the steering, which feels fairly numb and lifeless, but it's accurate at least.. Honda Pilot..  Toyota may have the edge in reliability, but Honda customers are consistently satisfied with their purchases. The Pilot is one of the least exciting mid-size SUVs on the road (it's basically a minivan with 4 doors), but it's comfortable and practical, with a big 3rd row (which can be folded down to make room for more cargo space). The seating position is higher than the others mentioned here, which may or may not make it more difficult to get in and out of. If the Mazda or Kia don't appeal to you, I'd give the Honda a shot, but it's probably bigger than you need, meaning you'll end up with lower fuel efficiency and fewer features for the money.. Other options fit the bill somewhat, but miss the mark in some areas: The Toyota 4Runner is one of the last mid-size SUVs with a body-on-frame design (ie, based on a pickup truck rather than a car), and while it has more off-road prowess than almost any of its competitors, its design and powertrain are old, fuel economy is poor, it's not comfortable to drive on the highway, the interior is full of unsightly plastic, and it's missing many safety features present on newer vehicles.. The Jeep Grand Cherokee is another with great off-road capability, and it actually balances out nicely as a daily driver for streets and highways as well. It's a wonderful SUV. But its reliability is its biggest downfall. Same goes with the Dodge Durango. I would certainly recommend them if reliability wasn't a huge issue, but all brands made by FCA (Jeep, Dodge, Ram, Chrysler, Fiat, Alfa Romeo, etc) have had reliability issues recently.. The Toyota Highlander is a very reliable three-row SUV, with similar capabilities and comfort levels as the Honda Pilot. But where the Pilot feels like you're driving a tall minivan, the Highlander is even more boring, without a chassis, suspension, or powertrain to make piloting it a fun experience in any way. You might feel differently about it if you test drive it, though!. The 2018 Chevrolet Traverse is an awesome redesign, surpassing the GMC Acadia in my eyes, since the 2018 Acadia still uses the old design. I can't speak to reliability, but you get a lot of SUV for the money with the Traverse, and the driving dynamics are better than expected..

The S4 is my current favorite of these cars, so I'm looking to see if anyone has any other recommendations similar to it. I've looked at a C43 AMG, but that starts getting a little out of my price range with some options added on, and I'm not really a fan of BMWs..

3803,IKnowNewCars," There are so many great entry luxury sedans out there that the TLX does sit sort of mid-pack. But you do get a lot of tech for the money, in a vehicle that's comfortable and decently capable. So it's up to you to figure out where your priorities lie. The sweet spot for the TLX is the V6 with SH-AWD without adding too many more packages or options. For $39k, it's a good value, assuming you're not looking for the sportiest driving experience.. Once you pass $45k, you'd get more for your money with a Lexus IS350 F Sport AWD, which comes with a very well-done chassis, sport suspension, really nice sport seats, digital instrument cluster, etc, for about $47k. You also get bulletproof reliability, as you know. But its infotainment system is a definite weak point, and the engine is a bit weaker than you would hope for at this price range. The GS350 uses the same engine, and while it's bigger and more comfortable, it feels even slower, and doesn't have the well-tuned chassis to make up for it. It's a smart choice if you drive it and like it, just not a very inspired one, in my opinion.. The Q50 is a great value in the segment right now, especially with its updates for 2018. It has three issues that come to mind:its interior refinement isn't quite at the level of its competitors, its transmission doesn't always shift how you want it to, and its optional Direct Adaptive Steering (one of its most unique and interesting features) takes away a lot of the steering feel you want in a sports sedan. If you can get past those things, you actually get a ton for your money with either the Q50 3.0T Sport AWD or the Red Sport 400 AWD, depending on how fast you wanna go and how much fun you wanna have.. The S4 is a car I would love to love, but I'm not 100% convinced by it just yet. The A4 is a total knockout, with an awesome powertrain that can run 0-60 in 5.2 seconds, lovely interior, lots of tech, and a wonderfully balanced driving experience at a great price. The S4 brings the speed up to 4.4 seconds 0-60, but so far most reviewers say the new 2018 model doesn't bring the thrills you'd expect, given its most direct competitors (the BMW 340i xDrive and Mercedes-AMG C43). It performs well, is super comfortable, and includes lots of standard features. Everything you could want in a sports sedan, except for that feeling you get when a real driver's car coaxes you to push it harder around the next turn. If you get my meaning. But you should test drive it and see whether or not you agree with me!. One more you should keep in mind:for a great value with great performance to match, try out the Kia Stinger GT AWD, which starts around $40k and is more spacious than most of the options you mentioned. Don't let the badge fool you. Its chassis and suspension were developed by some real industry veterans from Germany, the engine is damn quick (0-60 in 4.6 seconds), and you get a whole lot of car for the money..

3817,IKnowNewCars," There are plenty of options worth checking out, but you should keep in mind that things like wheel size can also change how much vibration is picked up from the road. I'll give you a few examples: The Buick LaCrosse is very smooth, comfortable, and spacious. The Essence and Premium trims are both very nicely featured, with the top Premium trim including massaging seats. Just make sure you stick with the 18"" wheels, as the 20"" ones start to feel bumps in the road a little stronger.. Cadillac can be a bit of a mixed bag here. A base CT6 is in your budget, but the nicer trims and engines are usually where you get the most for your money. The XTS is cheaper, but it's sort of disappointing in a few ways. And the CTS is much more geared towards driving lovers than comfort/luxury buyers. So you'll have to test drive the ones in your budget range and see what you think.. If you can swing it, another great recommendation would be a Mercedes-Benz E300 sedan. The starting price is fairly high, but you don't need to add many options to end up with one of the smoothest, most comfortable rides in your price range. Start with the base E300 sedan, add the Luxury Line (comfort-oriented suspension and smaller, more comfortable wheels), then add Air Body Control, an adaptive air suspension that makes the car even more plush and comfortable with a ride you can set to your liking. The total comes to about $56k, but I think it would absolutely be worth it.. The Lincoln Continental isn't my favorite executive car on the market, but it is one of the most comfortable for the money, if you build it right:Start with the Select trim, pick the 2.7L turbo V6 engine, then add the 30-way Perfect Position seats, which should maximize your comfort at this price range and in this class of car.

The dealership will try to scam you into replacing the WHOLE REAR SUBFRAME. That's a $2500+ service and you end up with the same silicone bushing that will wear out after another 60-70k. Instead, you can go to a private mechanic and have a solid bushing that should never wear out and it will cost you only like $500 parts &amp; labor.. As for the insurance, I had kept it on my parents insurance because we got a multicar discount, but now that it's on its own policy its about $960/6 months with a $1,000 deductible. I don't really know how it compares to other cars because its the first car I actually owned on my own..

It will be my second car, put way too much money and work into my last car, a 99 cr-v, but loved that thing to death. Don't think I want another one though. Have considered trucks, other suvs, and also considering something a bit sportier like maybe a charger or something along those lines. Can't do work on the vehicle myself. Im a 19yo college student, and don't really know what I should get or look for.

It‚Äôs kind of where I am leaning, in the middle trim.. The forester is nice in theory but I should have clarified when I said my wife that I am not her wife as well ;).

Must haves:Long term reliability, 4 doors, safety features/tech, best bang for the buck, not too expensive or crazy to fix (example:I was told to replace a headlight I have to take the whole bumper off on my 2013 Mazda 3, though the dealer could have been messing with me), fuel efficiency, mechanically sound. Desired transmission (auto/manual, etc):Automatic. Intended use:Daily Driver - suburbs/Highway. Vehicles you've already considered:2017 Toyota Corolla with Safety Sense, 2015 Mazda3, Honda Civic. Is this your 1st vehicle:No, Third. Had a 2000 Chevy Malibu and a 2013 Mazda3 SV.. Do you need a Warranty:I would prefer it.. Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:(fluids, alternator, battery, brake pads etc) No but my boyfriend can.. Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:(engine and transmission, timing belt/chains, body work, suspension etc ) No but my boyfriend can.. Additional Notes:I‚Äôm really agonizing over a decision, so please excuse this wall of text as an explanation. I was in my first accident (30) and I totaled my 2013 Mazda3 like an idiot. I‚Äôm super mad at myself, but anyway I‚Äôm looking for another car. I want it to be reliable and safe. Now, because the accident was my fault, I have lost confidence in my driving and decisions. My Mazda was a base model with none of the advance safety features that are out today. I‚Äôm wondering if I should make these new features a priority to help me. Most cars I can afford do not have these except a used 2017 Toyota Corolla, where collision warnings are standard. I liked my Mazda3, even though it had no features it drove nice. Then again, coming from my awful Malibu anything would have been better. Other cars that have received a lot of praise would be a Honda Civic, Honda Fit and the Mazda3, but these would need to be an older model to stay in my price range. I guess my question is to all of you, how important/life saving is this new technology to put it above other categories? How should it rank? The Mazda3 would have a blind spot warning, but not forward collision for example. Thanks for reading this. I know I‚Äôm basically going from no options to at least a back up camera but again I‚Äôm not sure what to prioritize. My boyfriend is no help, he wants me to get an s2000 but I know my insurance would go through the roof. I know they are awesome cars, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs practical for me.

3890,lonelyfriend," Okay. We all get into accidents eventually in life. Sometimes it's our fault, sometimes it isn't. Keep on driving and you'll get 'back to your normal' and continue to be diligent. Also, your BF sucks for asking you to get a nonsensical S2000 - haha. It's very natural to swing into the ""I care about safety"" when you get into an accident.. Anyway, what safety features are the most important? Airbags and seatbelts. Forward Collision is only being studied more now although it seems promising. Not all of them come with brake assist.. Seems like you like fun cars. And your BF will do labour to maintain it.. Anyway, this is long. Check out Lincoln. MKS, MKZ, they depreciate very well and could come with the features you want if you choose the premium packages. Their maintenance is ""OK"". Insurance should be OK, since only old people drive them. Otherwise, you're probably stuck with Toyota until these technologies become more standardized.

I also am in debt 180000 for student loans and such (~300/mo roughly) and buying a car would add on to that.

3895,IKnowNewCars," First, let's look at the two body styles you're choosing between. A mid-size sedan will probably have a more spacious cabin for passengers (especially the second row), while a small SUV/crossover will offer more flexible cargo space. Some people like feeling higher up in a crossover, though most driving enthusiasts would prefer the driving experience of a sedan, lower to the ground for better handling, plus often better fuel economy as well.. We'll start with sedans: Kia Optima. Kia's done a great job with the Optima chassis and paired it with a smooth-riding suspension. It feels upscale for the price. The LX 1.6T trim is an ideal choice at your price range, since it's quick, fuel efficient, and paired with a great transmission. Its only downside is that Kia hasn't quite got the refinement found on the more established Japanese sedans (this is apparent in the steering feel, which is more numb than I'd like, personally). And others have a more fun/sporty driving experience. But Kia reliability gets better every year, giving it a Top 5 spot in Consumer Reports' car brand reliability report this year. Great warranty too.. Honda Accord. The Accord is a favorite of car lovers every year, and the 2018 is even better. It's a Car &amp; Driver 10Best for 2018 (that's 33 of the past 35 years now), with two great new turbocharged engines, a slick new body design, and a fantastically balanced driving experience. To stay under $25k, you're looking at the base LX trim, which now includes Honda Sensing (active safety technology) as standard fare. The Sport trim is worth it for the extra $2000 if you can swing it. Truthfully, there's not many negative things you can say about the Accord.. Toyota Camry. I never gave the Camry a high recommendation until 2018. Now, on top of its reputation as the most reliable sedan on the road, its ride, handling, and powertrains come together to make a vehicle that's enjoyable to drive. It's not the quickest, or the sportiest, but it's comfortable and spacious, making it a very practical choice. The SE trim comes out to $26k, but its sportier suspension is definitely preferred over the LE's softer one if you want to enjoy your daily commute just a little more. Either way, if you go the Camry route again, don't settle for the 2017. The 2018 is a big improvement.. Hyundai Sonata. Kia and Hyundai share most of their platforms and powertrains now, so you'll find a lot in the Sonata that's shared with the Optima, including its great warranty. Kia's reliability has been rated a touch higher, and the interior of the Optima is a bit more refined than the Sonata, but Hyundai makes up for that with an even lower price tag. The Sonata Eco has the same awesome, efficient powertrain as the Optima LX 1.6T, along with lots of special features, for a cheaper price tag of $23,500. You can compare the two and see if the Kia is worth the extra cash, and compare both of them to the Accord and Camry.. If you decide that you'd like more cargo flexibility than these sedans have to offer, it's time to look at the crossovers.. Kia Sportage. The story with Kia's compact crossover is the same as its mid-size sedan:It has a great interior for the money, great reliability, a solid warranty, and lots of features for a good price, but may lack the refinement offered from the likes of Honda. Its fuel economy isn't great for its class, and its cargo space isn't top notch either. But the EX trim, which comes out to about $27k, is filled with great features, so bang for your buck is easy to find. If you can't go that high, the $24k base LX trim is also solid.. Honda CR-V. Just like the Accord, Honda has made one of the best all-around crossovers every year in recent memory with their CR-V, and it just keeps getting better. The cargo area is very spacious, top notch fuel efficiency, balanced driving dynamics, comfy interior, etc. Honda's reliability is higher than average, but rated lower than Toyota or Kia this past year. Like the Sportage, the EX trim comes out to almost $28k, but you get a lot for your money. The LX is more affordable and still a great choice.. Toyota Rav4. The Rav4 is as practical and reliable as it gets, with lots of cargo and passenger space, good noise isolation, and comfortable seats. Having said that, it's also one of the least fun-to-drive options in its class. The suspension feels subdued, the engine is on the slow side, and the non-hybrid option gets lower fuel economy than its competitors. But affordable crossovers don't get more reliable than the Rav4, so there are tradeoffs involved.. Test drive whichever of these appeal to you most, and if you need a couple other options that are particularly fun to drive, consider the Mazda 6 and CX-5 as well!.

3896,jumping_orange," Wow thank you so much for all of this great information! It seems like to me that Honda and Toyota are definitely the better value going forward, long term. While Hyundai and Kia are a bit cheaper now. I know that the latter have been performing better in recent years but is it reliable enough to contest with the Honda and Toyota's reputation long term? I have noticed that the Kia and Hyundai cars I've looked at right now have been about 3000 less than the Japanese counterparts. I've always heard great reviews about the Camry and the Accord though. Part of me does believe the Korean makers do know what they're doing now, but part of me is still somewhat skeptical comparatively.. I think the more I explore, I can definitely settle with a mid size sedan. I don't know that I will really need what the smaller SUV's offer that won't be mostly met by the sedan. The gas mileage is better by a bit and I think the cargo room seems just enough.. Just wondering based on your personal opinion which one you might choose, and a basic statement why? thanks!.

3897,IKnowNewCars," If you test drive each of the 4 sedans I listed, you might feel the difference between the Japanese and Korean models in their refinement and driving dynamics especially. That's going to be the biggest difference, more so than long-term reliability, in my opinion.. I'd go with the Accord. Honda just gets it. I haven't test driven this 2018 model, but everything I've read says it adds something to the previous models without removing any of the engaging driving experience they've done very well with. If it were me, I'd go with the Sport trim and a manual transmission, and either engine (1.5T or 2.0T), whichever I could afford. But even a base model could be a great value..

3898,jumping_orange," I will say, I have driven the Sonata so far, (plan to test drive camry and accord later today) and I will say compared to my current Camry, it does feel, idk a good way to put it, uninspiring haha. It wasn't that much fun. Granted I haven't test drove the 2018 one yet, just the 2017.. Thanks, I was kinda leaning towards the Accord as well. It seems very nice..

3899,IKnowNewCars," The 2018 Sonata is very similar to the 2017 one. Lots of exterior changes, but the interior is nearly the same, and the only powertrain change is a new transmission for the top-level 2.0T engine. I will say, if the 2017 one you drove had the non-turbo 2.4L engine, try driving a 2018 Sonata Eco if you go back. It's a more enjoyable powertrain, and it's quicker and more fuel efficient. Then compare to the 2018 Kia Optima LX 1.6.. You're right though, hard to say no to the Accord..

3900,jumping_orange," So I went and test drove the Accord, Camry, and the Sonata, and the Santa Fe and here is where I kinda was at the end (all in order) I think I'm going midsize over suv so didn't include santa fe. Driving Experience. Accord. Sonata. Camry. Interior. Camry. Sonata/ Accord. Comfortability. Accord. Camry. Sonata. Value. Sonata. Camry. Accord. Ease of Use (infotainment, the different settings, etc). Sonata - had Android Auto which is a plus for me. Camry/Accord (Accord had Android Auto but only in higher packages). Gas Mileage. Camry. Accord. Sonata. Each dealer/ brand seemed to offer similar services/ warranty/ all that extra stuff, but the financing at Honda seemed to be the worse (only cause they had no 0.0% APR, they had 0.9% APR which isn't a huge difference, but extra none the less. Overall. Accord. Camry. Sonata They seem to be asking about 2000 more for the Accord compared to the Camry, and 3000 more compared to the Sonata. I think generally Camry did very well, but I was really disappointed in the actual driving experience which is probably my no.1 factor. Would you think the extra 2000 for the Accord might be worth it? Of course I haven't really spoken about the price too much yet so that could change..

3901,IKnowNewCars," Great information! In order to give you more informed advice on the value of each model, given their price differences, though, I'll need a bit more: Were they all 2018 models?. What were the trim levels of each one you test drove?. Do you know which engine was in each one?. With that info, I can definitely tell you how I feel about each option.. ",Sub_Content, 6 months ago,t1_dqwklgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7hgoky/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
3902,jumping_orange," Yes they were all 2018. I think the Accord was an LX, sonata was an SE (LE?) I forgot the letters haha, and the Camry was an L I think... Uh the standard engines? I think they were just the common engine for the lower trims.. ",Sub_Content, 6 months ago,t1_dqwklgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/7hgoky/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
3903,IKnowNewCars," I'll touch on each one a bit then: The Accord is worth it at every trim level, so while I usually recommend the Sport trim because it includes Android Auto and some other nice features, saving $2000 and getting the LX trim is still a great value. It sounds like you can tell why car lovers say the Accord is their preferred mid-size.. The driving experience of most Camry models is still fairly boring, I get that. But if the one you drove was an LE, I recommend you try test driving a 2018 SE as well. For $1200 more, the SE adds a surprisingly fun sport suspension, along with exterior upgrades, comfier seats, and automatic climate control. It still won't have Android Auto, but if you liked other things about the Camry and wish the driving experience was better, the SE trim may give you exactly what you're looking for and still be cheaper than the Accord.. As expected, the Sonata provides good value, but misses out on some of what the more established brands have to offer. If you're still not set on an Accord or Camry, try test driving a Sonata Eco. It has a better engine, better transmission, and better fuel economy than the base SE model with only a $600 increase in price. It may or may not be enough to change your mind, but if you're still stuck, it might be worth a shot.. In short, I do think the Accord is worth it, but I'd try a different trim on both the Camry and Sonata if you wanna be 100% sure. But no matter what, you'll be getting a great car with any of these choices!.

3911,walaska," Aha, a question I feel I can contribute to because I'm basically in the same boat!. Whats the car market in Latvia like? If it's anything like Romania, it's well worth looking in Germany/Austria and bringing the car over/getting it delivered. Cars in this range get completely battered by the roads/crazy drivvers here, and buying them used locally is often a mistake. Another thing to keep in mind:in Romania, anything larger than 2 litres and over a certain age (2009 I think) is subject to increasingly brutal taxation. Check if there are similar laws in Latvia that will shaft you in costs if you haven't already (is it really worth paying 300 euros a year in tax if the car is only worth 2000?). Stay away from Alfa and Mercedes for that price.. I notice you left out the 3 series but maybe that was just an oversight. If it's too small,  consider a wagon, they're often cheaper and the ones I've tried have made me want more. A lot more. You're not going to get an acceptable impreza at that price, but maybe a good 4x4 Outback/Legacy?  I've looked in that price range and seen a lot of sexy-looking Saabs. Then again, you said running cost should be low. Since it's your first car, also consider Opel's offerings! The one I drive is a 1.7l Diesel and I'm ok most of the time in terms of speed (top speed is about 190kmh), but most importanlty parts are *cheap*.

3925,nephipower," I am looking into buying a new 2018 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring but I am not in a hurry to buy the car. This will just be a nice to have type of upgrade. Since the 2018 Model Year is a new redesign of the Accord it got thinking about what differences in features could possibly happen between Model Years?. The only thing I have found from my research is that some features from higher tier trims will trickle down to lower tiers. However, since I am planning on buying the touring trim which is Honda's highest end trim for an Accord what features could possibly change in between Model Years?. Would it just be under the cover part changes for quality issues?. Would there be any actual changes to visible end user features?. I'm trying to use this info to decide if I should wait a year for the 2019 MY even if it means just more reliable parts because they have had a year to figure things out.. Any thoughts or input on this question?. Any real life examples that you can share in features changes between MY for any car manufacturer?.

3931,supremedom," Hey all,. In advance, I'd like to say thank you for reading the post!. I currently drive a 2011 WRX hatchback, and I'm in the market for a new car. After extensive research over the past month, I am stuck in a pickle between a 2014 Infiniti Q60S Coupe and a the new STIs.. They are completely different cars, and each achieve different things. The Infiniti is luxury, V6 330hp with no turbo, and RWD, where the Subie is 305hp with a 2.5L V4 turbo, and AWD. I love both of the cars, but the Infiniti is about $5,000 to $8,000 cheaper, depending on the trim of the STI. I really only want white in both, and the STI rarely has market-appropriate used white ones. Both would be modded, starting with exhausts, wheels, air suspension, body kits, etc.. So basically, my question for you all is. What do you think is more worth it? Is a white STI worth that much more than the Q60S, where I can put the price difference into slamming it, an IPL body kit, and Motordyne exhaust setup? Those who own these cars, or work with them, please provide some advice. It is much appreciated..

4014,ohnoimrunningoutofsp," GTI nor focus ST is faster than FRS is it? GTI 0-60 5.9 and FRS around 6? Focus ST should be good bang for buck but if you ddin't like the test drive... Mustang GT is in your ball park unless that's too unrefined as well. Could get crazy good deals on a 2016 2017 new ecoboost. Enough power to have fun, quicker than the FRS, and save a bunch of money too. Then if interior is important you can get an ecoboosted with a lot of options.. The mustang also has a ton of trunk space btw. And 4 seats. Did you test drive the GTI?. I don't know if in your budget but certain used A3s and 2 series might be worth looking at if interior/luxury is important..

4025,eskamobob1," Location:  Southern California USA. Price range:  3-8k USD. Lease or Buy:  Buy. New or used:  Used. Type of vehicle:  Either utility or sport, still trying to look at my options in both categories. Must haves:  Must be able to handle drive in 95F+, be fairly reliable, be able to sustain ~70 MPH, ~20MPG+, and after that its down to looks. Desired transmission (auto/manual, etc):  Prefer manual, but if certain cars are better with autos (pajero for example) that is fine.. Intended use:  DD and weekend car (either camping on dirt roads, but no crawling, or possibly track if I go sporty).. Vehicles you've already considered:  See Below. Is this your 1st vehicle:  No. Currently own a 1974 Beetle and a 2008 Scion XB (would be selling the later for this car). Do you need a Warranty:  No. Predominantly looking at classics. Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:  Everything aside for major engine and transmission work I can do myself, including body work even though I dont like it. Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:  I dont have the space to pull and engine, so if I can do it while it is mounted, I am good to go. Additional Notes: SO here is kind of the rundown. I currently own a 1974 VW beetle that is my DD, and I love it. Problem is, I can drive it in over 95F without some major engine work, so im looking at a second car. I also have a 08 Scion XB currently, but its just not super inspiring, so I'm looking to sell it and get something more interesting. The thing is, I am kind of split over if I should get a more camping based vehicle that will likely be on the slower side like my bug, or get something a bit more fun to drive, but likely less versatile. Here are what I have considered so far. Late 80s Toyota Truck xtra cab. So Im still not sure about rwd or 4wd for these, but they run forever, look fairly nice, and im use to working on them. Plan for this one would be to ultimately put a flip pac on it and turn it into a more minimal camper (just realy a carpet kit with a built in box/seat or two) that I happen to dive in the summers. I do do a fair amount of woodworking currently, so being able to haul my own wood is a little nice, but I can always borrow a truck when i need to pick some up, so its ultimately not a huge deal. If I get  RWD I would likely raise to 2-3 inches just for a bit more clearance, but no bigger tires or anything like that. They are also not bad on gas with the 4x4 being ~20 and the RWD ~25.. 240z.  or similar. I absolutely love this car, but its realistically likely not that practical currently. ~17-18MPG, and kind of a crap shot of what will need to be done to it, so it would likely climb out of my price rage rather quickly. I have seriously wanted to own one forever though. late 90s or early 2000s Forester or Impressa Hatch back. I love WRXs, but the insurance on them is likely a bit too much for my tastes. The forester or impressa hatch backs seems like alright compromises though between a car that just more fun to drive and a car I can actually take to camp sites and such out dirt roads. I honestly have no extensively looked into these yet though, and I am a bit hesitant over how well that do both.. Late 90s Mitzubishi Pajero/Montero. Quite honestly, the 98 2dr 3L 6cy seems like the perfect car for me. 4x4 that can certainly handle dirt, but also not bad on mileage and Everything I have seen says its zippy and fun to drive. My main problem is, this car is just ugly as sin. I mean holy hell. Everything I can find also says to get the auto over the manual, which while isnt ideal, I will follow if I do get this car. I mostly just enjoy manuals, but an auto would probably bet better in traffic on a daily commute admittedly.. Other Cars. I have also looked at stuff like an E36, mk1 GTI, g35, 350z, Saab 9-2x, and even a rabbit TDI truck, but ultimately, I just am not sure I like the looks of the cars and I dont think their performance/utility is enough to make up for that. I can get a decent E30 in my range, which I am willing to do, but its going to take a fair amount of hunting from what I can find.. What else should I look into?.

4092,ThisisFKNBS," Personally I'd throw out the Porsche 911 4S as an option right away but if you like the attention of having people's head turn to see who is driving the car is, go for it.. Between the MB and the Audi, I think it comes down to the minute details such as options, interior/exterior color, engine preference (V8/V6), how close the dealerships/service areas are to me for loaners, etc. I hate the red interior in the MB but really love the tan/beige color. If the MB didn't have the Burnster/Harmon speaker upgrade but the Audi had the B/O sound system, I would be swayed towards the Audi. I love Audi's Nardo Grey over pretty much any color but I really dislike their 19"" wheel options. In both cars, you get that exclusivity feel where you don't see too many of them on the road albeit I think I've seen more S550s based on my own anectodal evidence.. The Audi is lighter and the quicker of the two cars but if you prefer a V8 or V6, that's for you to decide as well. I have always been partial to Audi so I am definitely biased. Mercedes has always been for me a car you're paying too much for.. Also, leasing/buying would make a difference too. If I were leasing, I'd go straight with the Audi since they'll be about similar price and you get a brand new car that you can tear open the way you want to and not worry about any maintenance. With a used car, you don't really know what could happen. If you're into winter/snow/rain driving, Quattro is hard to beat too.. If you're looking for MB, why not AMG C63S? You get similar price point, coupe, V8, exclusivity, 500hp+, quickest car by a very small margin out of the bunch.

4111,claymore5o6," Miatas are great as they are very easy to drive and are a great tool to learn stick.. I think the M2 is an absolute nutty performance car. They look fantastic, are offered in a manual, and have crazy performance. I do have a couple of personal concerns, but this is just my opinion and I haven't had the chance to drive one yet.. Many reviews have said how rough the car is to drive around. It's 'tuned for the track', but ultimately the road-going manners suffer a bit. My ND miata is modified for the SCCA STR class (600/300 spring rates) and it is rough to drive to work and back. I wouldn't want that on a new 'nice' car.. Price is also another factor for me. M2s are fairly expensive new. There are some incredible cars you can get for less money if you don't mind shopping for something a few years old.

4141,Gremlin87," Honda is generally regarded as a very reliable low maintainence brand (research the specific year you're looking at). The g37x should also be fairly low maintainence as it's from nissan but will be eating more gas than the civic (20mpg vs 28mpg for 2009 years) and using a bit more oil when doing oil changes. I would assume tires for the g37x would cost more as well..

4155,IKnowNewCars," My next car is gonna need 4 doors and be fairly inexpensive, so the Civic Si is near the top of my list as well. I'm also not crazy about the looks, but the Modern Steel color is pretty cool and does a good job of making the fake vents less noticeable. I'm not sure what colors are available in Canada, but I'd take a look at some of the darker color options in person. If you can get over the bumpers, you're looking at one of the best-handling FWD cars on the market, and possibly the best handling in its price range overall.. I can understand being cautious about the FoST, but honestly, you should be able to get a VERY good deal on one, and replacement parts will still be available for a very long time, both from Ford and from aftermarket manufacturers. The interior isn't amazing, and it has almost more power than the chassis can handle, but that's partly the fun of it. It's a blast, and worth test driving at least.. The WRX is probably the best 4-door performance in its price range, but as a daily driver it's a mixed bag. Symmetrical AWD is great for any weather, and you can even put the pedal down on dirt roads and stay on course, which is a blast. But the suspension is firm, which negatively affects ride quality. Turbo lag is present, though it's not as bad as before. And the manual transmission isn't nearly as nice as the Honda, with fairly long throws on the shifter and a less-than-ideal clutch. You'll just need to test drive it and see how it feels to you. The ideal WRX for me would be a Premium trim model with the Performance Package, but that comes out to $32k USD, so it may be out of your price range in Canada, and I'm not even sure what the trim levels look like over there, to be honest.. The GTI is the ideal daily driver in a lot of ways. It's comfortable, refined, practical, and so fun to drive. To get the most performance out of it, you'd opt for the SE trim in the US (includes a small power boost, nicer differential, upgraded brakes, etc), but again, the price tag is pushing it a bit. Long-term reliability isn't something the GTI has a reputation for, but VW increased their warranty this year to 6 years/72k miles bumper-to-bumper in the US, which makes a huge difference.. Having said that:whatever maintenance costs you'd expect with a GTI, make them even bigger with a BMW, and of course they'd happen sooner as well, since it would be used. Other folks here can give you more insight into what buying a used BMW entails, but don't expect that it will be the most financially-responsible decision.. A lot of this will come down to test drives. They're all great in their own way..

I'm looking to buy my first new vehicle-- I have reservations about buying used vehicles as I'm not very car savvy.  I am much more comfortable buying a new vehicle.. In my area I went to do a quick comparison, I found that for the Mazda 3 with no down-payment, the interest rate is 0.99% and monthly payments are approximately $300 CAD.  In comparison the Honda Civic is 1.49% and approximately $476.. I understand that the Honda Civic has a great track record and has a better selling value later on.  However I plan for this to be a vehicle I drive for the next 10 years or so and by then I'll likely purchase a new vehicle.. I have a few questions as well:I was told hy the Honda salesman that for vehicles such as the Mazda 3 and Honda Civic, the MSRP is not really marked up to make a profit and it's not likely they'll knock off much money.  He told me he's been selling Honda Civics with the most price knocked off at approx. 300~600 dollars CAD.  The MSRP price for the model I'm looking at is approximately $24,000 CAD.  (Honda SE CVT). Right now, I'm leaning towards the Mazda 3 as I do like it's appearance more, but the most enticing part is the difference in monthly payments. A friend of mine who knows a bit more about cars than me noted that Mazda's don't have a good reputations down the line as having a poor transmission and is known for being a rust bucket..

It'll come in lower than a brand new GS.. To add onto some other things: Android Auto / Apple CarPlay is on the way for the fall as a software update (might cost a bit for not-new models). There's also fairly easy ways to add it yourself.. Rust is supposedly fixed on 3rd gen Mazda 3's. In my area at least, Mazda dealers are a lot more negotiable on these cars.

4195,gsasquatch," I bought a car once that a dealer said passed their ""99 point service check""  Which apparently meant clearing the codes so the buyer (me) wouldn't find out about the $700 catalytic converter until after the check cleared.. On the other hand though, the CPO risk  would be the same pretty much in CA of FL, so, it'd be a risk you'd take on either coast, unless you have some great knowledge.       Maybe it's worth a trip to Fla?  Maybe a chance to go to a theme park, or go to Miami Beach?    Coming from Ca that might not be as appealing as it would be for someone coming from north.  Driving it back could be an adventure and a vacation opportunity.. Maybe the ""certified"" part of CPO could help, but it'd be hard to go after the certifier if you're not up in their face literally.    The other side of that coin is if it's BMW corporate that's certifying it and you could go after the local dealer as an extension of corporate.    I did that with a repair that went wrong at a dealer 1000 miles away, but it took a lot of yelling at the remote dealer to get them to cover the part they broke.    You kind of give up the value of ""certified"" with the distance, except that it might have met some sort of standard, which would be good..

A 350z, GTI or RSX in your price range is going to be seriously beat on (at least they are up here in NY). 6-8k should get you a miata in excellent shape, and even with 100k on the odometer i'd feel confident enough in the reliability to daily it. Maintenance and parts are cheap, and it's got a staggering amount aftermarket support. Since it's your first car, you're less likely to get murdered on the insurance payments than with a GTI or 350z.

4233,velociraptorfarmer," I'd be weary of Grand Cherokees. I had a 97 ZJ and it had all sorts of electrical issues and my brother's 99 WJ is the same way.. One concern with 99-01 XJ's with the 4.0L is that the heads are prone to cracking, which is a major issue and expensive to fix.. If you're concerned with MPG, I'd honestly advise to stop right now. In stock form, they'll maybe get 22hwy/15city. If you lift it, you'll be lucky to get 15hwy/10city.. They're prone to rust so get underneath and look closely, especially in that area (mine came from SE Minnesota). Also, don't buy one that's already been modified, you'd be asking for trouble..

4268,Komcor," Location:United States, closer the better to Charlotte NC. Price range:$100k. Lease or Buy:Buy. New or used:Used. Type of vehicle:Sports Car. Desired transmission (auto/manual, etc):Either. Intended use:Weekend and Track. Vehicles you've already considered:AMG GTS, 981 GT4, 911.1 GTS, Considered stretching for a 911.1 GT3. Is this your 1st vehicle:No. Do you need a Warranty:No. Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:Yes. Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:No. Additional Notes: I've been tracking my C63 more often and now I have the track bug. This thing isn't a track car in the slightest and will go through tires like crazy so I'm looking for a weekend car that will be tracked once a month. AMG GTS ticks all the boxes but when I drove one it felt way too big, like I was driving a barge. It's almost as heavy as my car and that bothers me, but it's got an appeal like none other, not to mention they're getting cheap (85k).. The GT4 is the other contender I've looked at and I haven't ever driven a manual on a track so I'm kinda nervous I'd fuck something up. Price is very similar to the GTS and might even drop more once the 718 GT4 gets released.. The 911.1 GTS felt very similar in terms of straight line performance to my car, it was fast but not blistering, throw your head back into the seat, fast. Obviously it was a corner king though which outshines my car any day of the week. These are going for around 100k right now, so I'm real curious how it compares to a GT4 on the track. PDK is also a bonus. Also, I've noticed some 911.1 Turbos have dropped to a very similar price.. The 911.1 GT3 is the car I want but when I compare it to the AMG GTS, I don't see it being worth 40k more. Performance is similar, and I felt more confident when I drove it since it's obviously lighter than the GTS. But 40k more? It's a steep price.. My other option I suppose is to get a Cayman S and mod the hell out of it, but I'm not to thrilled about a 4 banger. I guess my real question is to AMG GTS owners or people who've driven it on a track -- is the weight something that is just a learning curve or do you have to manage it constantly? How often do you need to switch tires?. ",Main_Content, 12 days ago,t1_e0iftxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8q8pof/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

4321,river4823," Thanks for your suggestions. I think the the Avalon is worth looking into, but I don't think she'd really be into a Lexus, even if the Lexus ES is basically just a fancier Avalon. She's also looking at a Camry Hybrid, but apparently they're hard to find because they're very popular. Would that be a good option? The Corolla doesn't have a hybrid version which puts you in the odd position of having to get a bigger car for better fuel economy.. The Mazda is nice, and I might get it for myself, because it looks really good. But it's gas mileage is only okay and it doesn't have some of the fancy new emergency brake and lane assist features that the Toyota has.. I'll be honest. I'm a bit confused about whether my mom wants a small car. She said the Honda Civic was too big, but that she didn't like the Fit.

4345,ctrann7," From the years you've looked at, I'm assuming you'd prefer to lease? BMWs have higher residuals which makes their leases more appealing to people. The 5 makes for a great ride with smooth power delivery with an updated styling as well so it'd be more fresh. Since you've looked at the 5, the A6, and the ES, why not have a look at the E-Class as well?.

4347,ctrann7," Definitely different options depending on your situation. If you plan on driving the car for a few years in the (gas 'n go) lifetime of the vehicle and give it back after, then lease is definitely a good option. Since the residuals are higher on BMWs, they tend to have lower lease payments for the term compared to some other competitors. Good luck! Wish I had these car choices haha.

My price range was under 10k at first, but my dad wanted it lower, so it dropped to 8k. Like the same situation you had mentioned where you cannot really find anything, you could always ask to pay for half of the car, so you can raise the price. Maybe then you could find a car for 12k and they still only pay 6k. If you don‚Äôt have money yet, get a job or tell them that you can pay them back. Try a CarMax and you can get a real cheap 2011 Nissian Rouge for 11k. If your parents wouldn‚Äôt agree to it, how I found my first car was by going to a populated city‚Äôs main street that sold cars. If you know of one, keep looking every week until you get lucky. I didn‚Äôt necessarily need a car at first, more so wanted one.

I'd really appreciate any suggestions or help. My plain amount of research led to the models I mentioned, CX-5, CR-V, RAV4, Escape and Compass. I'm leaning more towards the CX-5 and Compass but just wanted some opinions from more experienced people to aid in my decision.We're planning on going to a dealership mid-July. Thanks in advance!.

4385,IKnowNewCars," The CX-5 is my favorite crossover in its class this year. It's very fun to drive next to any of its competitors and it has one of the best interiors for the money. Its only real downsides are a smaller back seat and smaller cargo space than others in its class (like the CR-V, which is particularly spacious and probably my second favorite overall). But if the CX-5 meets your practicality needs and you can get a good lease deal on it, absolutely give it a shot..

4387,PorscheAX, Is there a reason you need the car to be so new?  It will lose a ton of value from depreciation just sitting there especially if she doesn't use it that much.  You could easily save some money and get an older model corolla or something nicer like a Lexus IS 250 or similar for the same price and it would be just as reliable.. If you need the latest driver assists then I think you had the right idea initially by just getting the same thing again and making sure it's fully loaded with features.. ,Sub_Content, 1 day ago,t1_e14132v,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8ryp5n/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

They are surprisingly cheap and definitely have the space and fun factor though they don't have the poise of most of the cars you've been looking at. They are cheap to work on and the handling can be improved fairly cheaply.  Maintenance wise something like a Mustang would definitely hurt your wallet less then a BMW..

4449,xMrBarney," You seem to be leaning more towards hatchbacks, but mention sedans as a possible option. Have you considered the Acura TL? One of the few sedans that can be had with both a leather interior (nice for cleaning up dirt/mud, as opposed to cloth) and a stick, absurdly reliable. Might not be the best for any mild trails up to mountains though with the ground clearance.. Subaru Outback would be another good choice. Stick, built for mild offroading, fairly decent gas mileage as well.. Regarding the models you listed above, stay away from the Eclipse &amp; TC, look more towards the MS3 or Golf/GTI. MS3 is a bit better in reliability and definitely better at overall cost of ownership, but something about those little VW's is just too much fun..

The fit and finish of the VW is better, and it will hold its value better (marginally), but will be more expensive long-term. Especially if you plan to keep this car for 3+ years..

4459,xMrBarney," I'll start with the cars you mentioned on your list: BMW - Just no. As a lover of all things 2003 or earlier BMW, I will tell you to avoid newer BMW's. They just aren't what they used to be with the exception of a couple cars (like the new M5, omg). You summed up the E-Class Coupe reasoning pretty well with the Mazda 6 comparison.. SLK is horrible for anything 30+ miles, especially if you're 6'+ or have anything more than 6 grocery bags.. 08-11 SL/CL - Avoid like the plague unless you can afford $2-5k in annual maintenance costs. A good rule of thumb when buying luxury pre-owned cars; Just because you can get a car that was $100k new for $30k a few years later doesn't mean you get the maintenance cost of a $30k new car - it's still a $100k car. If you're not worried about maintenance or the lack of features when compared to your RC, then keep considering it. They are wonderful cars if you can afford to maintain them correctly. But, you might as well get an older Porsche at that point.. A5 - Not bad, but they just lack power. Good curb appeal, but in my opinion anyway, the S5 is where you have to start if you care about the driving experience.. Have you considered a Golf GTI with an APR Tune? Maintains your factory warranty, so no issues there - really wakes the car up and is an absolute blast to drive. Once the factory warranty is up, maintenance can get a little pricey, but they are a treat if you maintain them well. Plus, they're actually fairly practical if you need it to be while still maintaining a fun sports car experience.. Another oddball, but since you seem to want to have a fun weekend vehicle with the ability to be a convertible if you want, have you considered a Jeep Wrangler? Not necessarily the best for driving in the city in SF, but would be awesome to take the top/doors off for driving along the coast, and also opens up some mountain trails or even hitting Big Bear in the winter. Not to mention very strong resale value - I mean, who doesn't love a good Jeep anyway?. Last, which I'm sure is ""too practical"" for your scenario but I'm only mentioning it due to the Mazda 6 comment, is the Kia Stinger GT. It's a sedan, yes, and a Kia, yes, but damn is it fun to drive. I have a Lexus IS-F, and if it weren't for the fact that the IS-F is a 5.0L V8 combined with the lack of exhaust note from the Stinger, I would've leased a Stinger instead of buying a used IS-F like I did. Don't knock it until you drive it.. ",Sub_Content, 2 days ago,t1_e10ws5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8ryp5n/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
4460,FlamingTelepath," Thanks for the advice :. 08-11 SL/CL - Avoid like the plague unless you can afford $2-5k in annual maintenance costs.. I don't really mind this because the way I'm interpreting it is more like $2k-$5k per 10,000 miles.  If I'm driving 4,000 miles a year, maintenance won't be too bad.  Maybe I'm wrong?. But, you might as well get an older Porsche at that point.. Yea, I considered this.  I was looking at older Boxsters a bunch and like the idea a lot, but I'm a little worried about the ride comfort - I really do want to prioritize comfort over speed (mostly since my girlfriend gets motion sickness).  I've driven a Macan recently, and that was very nice, but I can't quite justify the price.. Have you considered a Golf GTI with an APR Tune?. I've never experienced a Golf with a smooth ride... I imagine a tuned one would be even stiffer.  The car is probably fun to drive, but I can't imagine it would be a nice car for driving 2-3 hours somewhere, especially for any passenger.. have you considered a Jeep Wrangler?.

4463,drivingdaily69," I have heard that about the transmission, even in the RCF, which is unfortunate because with a good transmission, I feel like those cars could be much better. You do have a good point that a lot of the stuff you get in a Lexus you can also get in a upper-trim Toyota, but I have noticed that Lexus has better craftsmanship in general (e.g. better materials surrounding you, Lexus usually gets the tech before Toyota, etc) but some Toyota models are starting to sneak up there in that respect.. This is a bit out in a stratosphere, but have you considered a couple-year old Cadillac CTS-V? I‚Äôm not sure if there are any brands you want to avoid or anything like that but I feel like a CTS-V ticks many of the boxes you‚Äôre looking for. Granted, I‚Äôve never been in one at all, so I can‚Äôt attest to ride quality or how luxurious they are but generally, most CTS-V reviews I‚Äôve seen/read have given the car good marks. Might be a little more power than you‚Äôre looking for, and the price might be dangerously close to your upper limit, but I‚Äôd say give it a shot.

4467,lonelyfriend," The Q50 made the car much more luxury oriented than sporty compared to the G37. Also the company had cheap leases which means this car may be below your price range for 2014 to 2015.. The RX is a beautiful car and to be honest the Acura side doesn't touch it. But there is also the Acura TL 12 to 15 which is above BMW interior with weird controls but a really nice drive, in my opinion. The TLX is a great car but is the worst car in a competitive space - worst drive (not bad in the grand scheme) and also interior isn't as good as Mercedes, Audi, Lexus or even Infiniti.. I'm currently looking at the mid 20s to low 30s for an Acura TLX Elite for my partner. The equivalent cars other than the Infiniti are much more expensive..

It was noticably  more comfortable. Unfortunately in the USA we don't get many wagons with a manual, so a used 328 wagon probably wouldn't do it for you.. Outside of the GTI and ST, you'll probably struggle to find something sporty which isn't compromised in some way. The VW Alltrack has volume but is down on power. The civic si doesn't come in a hatch. The new veloster turbo/n are quite small. Elentra GT Sport is closer in size but definitely down on the fun to drive metric (no lsd, under 200 lb-ft of torque)..

You'd have a car that's very fun and sporty to drive, one of the nicest interiors in its price range, a sun roof, paddle shifters for controlling a great automatic transmission, and pretty solid fuel economy to boot. MSRP is under $27k, but you can probably get that to $25k at the dealership. The only downside I can think of is that it won't have quite as spacious of an interior as the Optima, and there is a bit more wind noise on the highway than in its competitors.

4497,r_golan_trevize, Mustangs don't give good economy. That depends. City MPG should range from 15~18 mpg depending on how much loud pedal you use and maybe a little higher if your daily commute contains any stretches 45+ mph where you can get in the higher gears for a bit.. Highway mileage should be in the upper 20s.. That's for a V8. The V6 are a little better but not significantly and not enough to forego the sound of a V8. The Ecoboosts can apparently deliver real economy improvements over the V6 and V8s though if that's a priority.. and are very expensive to maintain.. Where'd you hear that?

4516,psychotronofdeth," The RX 8 is known to be unreliable. Most people will say that if you take care of it, it'll be fine.. But, I still think it's unreliable. It has horrible fuel efficiency. If you're delivering pizzas, you're going to be spending a lot of money on gas.. Minor work on it is pretty easy. If you're unlucky, things that may go bad other than the Apex seals are the fuel pump and cat.. It's like, if one thing goes bad, it's going to cause so many other components of the car to go bad.. And as for why people by them... They can be fun to drive! If it's your taste though. So you should definitely test drive one.. The car has like no torque. You're going to be doing 6k (car redlines at like 9k though) and sound like you're ripping it, but you're really not going that fast.. If Western Colorado has fun roads though, the car can be fun if you keep its rpms high. It's pretty punchy once they're up there.. So, it's definitely a car you'd need to drive to see if it's fun factor is worth the high maintenance for it.. I know most of this because I just helped my friend get his rx8 running again.

Only reason to go for those imo would be mpg (for highlander hybrid) or sportiness (for the Mazda). Pilot was very very meh.. We ended up getting an Atlas, which was the best on:size &amp; practicality, cargo space, infotainment (we use Android auto), ride comfort with limited road noise, safety features (tied with a few others), crash test scores, and warranty. As mentioned, not the best on:mpg and sporty acceleration. The leatherette seats are the newest VW kind, and although there aren't long term usage reviews yet, they feel good and still show zero sign of wear 6 months in.

Looks like Chevy doesn't want my business much.. I've returned several times to sit in the Mustang, as well as check out other stuff on the lot like a Focus ST and Fiesta ST. Between those two, I'd lean focus, but the pedal placement is a bit weird. Reason I lean focus is because the fiesta's wheels and tires are TINY in diameter.. And, despite being about the same lengthwise and height wise for passengers(not cargo, though), it's skinnier. Focus has more width, and a tad more legnth to the cargo area behind the rear seats, and bigger wheels/tires, so I like all of that better. Oh, and more power with a bigger engine, of course. ;).

G37. :It looks like a plain car, there's no getting around it. And a slightly dated design, having the same basic appearance all the way back to 2003? Yeah.

Either way, being 1-2 years out from purchase gives me plenty of time. Being a Lexus[luxury Toyota], that should nail the niceness and reliability. And being a '15, that should also help the niceness. Just the car itself will probably get me more sugar points from females than the plain G37 or ""Broseph""/""that weirdo car-loving person"" Ecoboost Mustang. I think I'll go check one out.{which is better than the 'might' I gave to the G37}. Audi S5. :Ah yes. A Euro suggestion. I expected it would come anyway, at least it IS an Audi, which, I'd also recon/assume to be more reliable than the others. And I'm sure it's VERY nice on the inside. And, hell, I LOVE the outside, to be honest. The proportions are very nice. Not too long-ish like the 'Stang. Not weird looking like the Lexus. Not plain like the G37. And I'm CERTAIN that this car would make me look the most wealthy and attractive to women. It's probably also the all-around nicest of the group.. But, two main problems. I currently THINK that I want a car to mod and be able to take to a track day, drift day, or drag day event. I've been drag racing in my truck, and aside from sitting in the heat and having to wait in line, the shit was fun, even with this big slow Heffalump.. But what about in a car as premium and nice as this Audi? Would I dare drift it or track it? Probably not drift, likely would be more against tracking it than for... I'd still likely take it to the strip, though. That seems simple and easy enough besides driveline stress. But the thing is, what if I do one of the other activities once and like them too much? Then I have this nice ass car that I'm beating the hell out of. Not good IMO, especially since it's a euro car, which leads me back to the entire reason I made this whole criticism post.... It's not just the unreliability, it's the cost. The overall cost, the service cost, and even just the parts cost since I plan on doing any of the work I CAN do to it, myself. What if, for example, a mustang whatever is half the price of Audi's part? Or a third, even? It's not impossible, after all, and that's where my issue with Euro lies. If it ain't breaking down often, when it does, it'll cost ya. At least that's the common assumption.. On a side note, the Audi seems so nice that I think I'm definitely going to go and check it out. Forced induction V6 manual with room to grow in a nice chassis with nice body and interior? That'll make me look richer than I am and henceforth attract women? Yeah, that's kinda what my boss has going with his CLA250. It's working for him if only in short-term runs, but still... Sounds almost like a win-win, especially since my laziness might very well lead to me NOT modifying a car as much as I say I want to.... Anyway, if you or anyone else has any input on this or more suggestions, y'all are more than welcome. I like being prepared, so, despite being 1-2 years out, this helps a lot. And, of course, as I draw ever closer, I'll occasionally repost the question every now and then in whatever iteration of the mega thread exists at the time, of course, refining it as I go and posting more of my own findings from checking out the best of the selections..

I'm a student but have pretty good income, my commute is 45 miles each way but I want to avoid owning two cars. So so mpg is tolerable. My partner and I ski a lot so snow ability is essential. We have a huge lab and he's not allowed to ride in bed of truck so back seat only. We like to hike and road trip, and we're thinking of getting a boat that would weigh around 5000 lbs on the trailer. I'm thinking about getting into woodworking so a truck bed might be nice, but other times it's gonna be wasted space my dog could be stretching out in. I'm leaning towards a V8 4runner because I'm not sure if the v6 would be able to tow the size boat we want. The opening rear window would be good for my pooch as well. Jeep Grand Cherokee is tempting as well, including the Mercedes diesel powered model. The build quality scares me though. I'm retiring a 2000 Jeep Cherokee and it's a flimsy tin can with a great power train.

Things that could go wrong/normal issues. Other ideas are Porsche Cayenne Toyota Land Rover 2010 Ford F-250 or Chevy/Dodge equivalent.. ,Main_Content, 5 days ago,t1_e0v6xjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8ryp5n/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
4593,jbag14," OK everyone. I would really appreciate your help in this endeavor of finding the perfect vehicle. I've been through a few lately and... they just don't fit the billet. Help is so much appreciated.. Location:  Kansas City, MO. Price range:  $50K. Lease or Buy:  Buy. New or used:  either. Type of vehicle:  I think a small SUV but that is part of the dilemma. Must haves:  All wheel drive (I am a physician and HAVE to be able to get to work and I also go snowboarding quite alot and AWD systems have saved me before). Desired transmission (auto/manual, etc):  Manual (that's part of my problem, it's so hard to find a manual in what I am looking for). I had an automatic Subaru outback that seemed to fit the bill but i could NOT get over not having a manual as that is all I have ever driven.. Intended use:  Daily driver, dog transportation. Vehicles you've already considered:  Subaru Forester (eh...just was not very exciting- still in the running), Toyota Tacoma (terrible mpg), Jeep Wrangler (bad mpg, poor in highway). Is this your 1st vehicle:  No. Do you need a Warranty:  Not really. Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:  Yes. Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:  No. Additional Notes: It's very difficult finding an SUV or small SUV with manual transmission. I don't mind if it's older. I just need the room for activities for my dog and I as well as the manual. Highway ability would be ideal because we travel quite a bit to go snowboarding and I have heard that Jeeps are terrible on the highway (but have also never driven one). Ive also looked at some of the older subaru outbacks that were in manual but it's SO difficult to find a well maintained used one. I'm willing to spend pretty much whatever it takes for ""the one."". Anyone have any ideas? Am I crazy should I just ditch the manual dream?. ",Main_Content, 5 days ago,t1_e0v8z4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8ryp5n/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

4606,gooseycat," Location:  Southeastern Ontario. Price range:  Up to $20000 CAD ideally, could spend more if needed but would need to be convinced. Lease or Buy:  Buy. New or used:  Either, if the warranty is worthwhile could do new, but happy with used. Type of vehicle:  Probably some sort of compact hatchback, but can consider something a bit bigger. Must haves:  Fuel efficient, hatchback, cruise control, A/C, reverse camera. Desired transmission (auto/manual, etc):  Automatic. Intended use:  Drive to work most days, some weekend road trips. Vehicles you've already considered:  Mazda3 2014 and beyond, Civic, Elantra. Is this your 1st vehicle:  Yes. Do you need a Warranty:  No. Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:  My partner could but would probably prefer not to have to. Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:  No. Additional Notes:  Currently just for me and my partner, but likely having kids in the next 1-2 years.

We are leaning used but if the warranty is worthwhile we can do new. We have the cash to buy outright.

4628,MuffinRacing," RWD hatchbacks are very difficult to find. The Kia Stinger is a good answer to this.. BMWs toe that line of ""sporty and luxury"" well.

If you're used to skipping oil changes or not going by the owner's manual for service limits, Lexus is a good option..

4629,IKnowNewCars," When folks say ""used is better,"" it's because the car has already gone through its most rapid depreciation, so you generally get more car for your money. Keep in mind, though, that it may be out of warranty, and it will be closer to old age, when repairs will become more expensive and more frequent. If you plan on buying the car and keeping it for 10 years, I think you stand to gain a lot by buying new instead of used. But that's just my opinion!. Of course the bummer is that the best versions of a lot of these RWD entry luxury cars are just over your $40k budget limit, so you'll have to see what kinds of deals you can get if you end up going new: When I think of a reliable luxury sedan, the Lexus IS certainly comes to mind, and if you opt for the IS350 F Sport, you're getting a very sporty version of it with a well-built chassis. Sadly, the MSRP of the F Sport version is $46k, and discounts off MSRP won't be huge. This might be a good one to get 1-2 years used, since Lexus reliability is still fantastic and you'll probably have a rather low cost of ownership.. The Stinger GT is one of the best luxury sports sedan deals out there. It misses out a bit on refinement and performance at the limit when compared to its direct rivals from BMW, Audi, etc, but you get so much fun and performance for the money overall. The GT1 starts at $44k MSRP and is my usual recommendation for its adaptive dampers, improved sound system, sunroof, etc, but another great option is to opt for the GT trim and add the Limited Slip Differential, giving you an awesome driving experience for only $41k MSRP before dealer discount. Compared to the IS350 F Sport, it's an absolute speed demon, and its interior is very spacious.. Infiniti's reliability hasn't been as high as other Japanese brands like Lexus, but they generally offer bigger discounts off MSRP than the likes of Lexus. The Q50 is one of those cars that's best when configured in a balance between the base and high-end models, so consider test driving a Q50 3.0t, which starts at $40k. It's gonna be less sporty than the other options here, so feel free to opt for the Luxe trim rather than spending extra on the Sport one. It looks nice and it's quick, but it does feel like it misses out on what some other brands have to offer.. The bummer is that other options on the market all give up something compared to what you're looking for:either they're too expensive, or not as reliable, or not RWD, or not spacious enough. The only other option I can think of the Genesis G70, which looks awesome but isn't quite available yet, so I can't say for sure how ideal it will be. Worth test driving, though!.

4650,IKnowNewCars," First thing's first, if your car needs 4 seats, you'll wanna skip the Miata, which only has two seats and a small trunk. Personally, I think opting for a RWD sport coupe like the BRZ would be the next best thing, so if you don't need to sit people in the back very often, I'd go that route. I recommend test driving a BRZ Limited with a manual transmission and the Performance Package, which adds nicer wheels, Brembo brakes, and performance dampers (shocks/struts) at a really reasonable price. It'll be a ton of fun to drive. It might not be as quick as some of the other options, but there's something about driving a lightweight RWD car on a twisty road at speed that's hard to beat for the price.. If the BRZ still doesn't meet your practicality needs, I'd go the pony car route. The 2018 Mustang improved on the EcoBoost engine, and configured properly it can be a fantastic buy:an EcoBoost Premium with the Performance Package takes the MSRP to $34k, and if you want the adjustable MagneRide suspension that adds $1700 to that price tag. All this is before manufacturer incentives and dealer discounts, so in all, you should be able to get it for thousands less than MSRP. The back seat isn't huge, but it's a bit more usable than the BRZ's. Similarly, if you want the best track-ready performance you can get for the price, the Chevy Camaro V6 1LE has got your number. MSRP starts at $33k, with the leather-trimmed 2LT versions bringing that to $37k, each before incentives and discounts.. If you decide that 4 doors and a hatchback will give the car a lot more usable practicality in your case, there's a world of performance compacts that opens up to you. The Civic Type R is my favorite:for $35k, you get a car that's both incredibly quick and capable on a track, and comfortable and practical as a daily driver. The Ford Focus RS and Volkswagen Golf R are both fantastic competitors to the Type R, so all three are worth test driving, but the Type R starts cheaper than the others. Finding one at MSRP can be a bit hard, as lots of dealerships are still marking them up a lot, but if you call around, you may be able to find one near MSRP. It's at least worth test driving.. I'm sure there are other options, but in your price range, I think you've hit on the most fun-to-drive ones out there. Test drive some cars and see what you think!.

4651,Sky296, Thanks for the reply! Not sure why I put the Miata up there lol. Funny because at the end I was in between the BRZ and the Type R. Just not sure which one from the 2 and also if I should just wait for the 2019 to see if there‚Äôs any changes. I don‚Äôt have to get a new car until November as that‚Äôs when my lease ends.. ,Sub_Content, 5 days ago,t1_e0w2s8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8ryp5n/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
4652,IKnowNewCars," Starting to think about it now is a great idea, it feels much better having a few months to mull over your different options before you really need to buy. Coming from a driving enthusiast point of view, the BRZ would end up being my choice if I didn't have to worry about practicality, simply because it provides a very pure driving experience:lightweight, an engine that lets you squeeze all of its power out on normal roads, a very well-built chassis, and a rear-wheel drivetrain that lets you inject some controlled oversteer into your drive. But test driving both will give you exactly the insight you need, and of course there's no denying the practicality benefits of a 4-door hatchback.. As far as 2019 goes, the only car that might be worth waiting for is the Hyundai Veloster N. We've already seen some testing of the new generation Veloster, which drives and looks better than before, but the N version will have 275 HP, an awesome-sounding exhaust, and a great suspension to pair with the improved chassis to make for a great-driving performance compact. If you can get past its somewhat odd 3-door design, it might be just the balance of fun and practicality you're looking for. Read more about it . here. ..

4678,RobotDebris," Here are some other cars in your area I found that should be fairly reliable and fun. Hyundai Veloster Turbo, Mazda Miata, VW GTI, Hyundai Genesis Coupe, Saturn Sky, Pontiac Solstice.. Not sure if you're into convertibles but that's a good mix of hatches, convertibles and coupes.. I was looking for a Civic Si but I was unable to find any... Random other cars that are older and probably not what you're looking for, but both with &gt;280hp (shhhhh): 2004 Ford Thunderbird. 2002 Chevrolet Camaro Z28. Regarding your current choices, I don't know too much about the Mustang but the BRZ/FR-S are definitely reliable, albeit a bit gutless especially with an Auto. Mini Coopers are known for bad reliability so I might stay away from that if reliability is a big deal..

4698,IKnowNewCars," They're very different cars. The A4 is an entry-luxury sports sedan that's quick, fun to drive, comfortable, and luxurious, but obviously more expensive than the Subaru. The WRX is a sporty, aggressive compact with harsh ride quality, some noticeable turbo lag, and a less-than-ideal manual shifter, but it's a whole ton of fun and a lot of car for the money.. If you're really not sure between the two, I'd test drive them in these configurations and see how you feel: Subaru WRX Limited w/ Nav &amp; Harman Kardon package:$35k MSRP. Audi A4 Quattro Premium Plus w/ Navigation, Sport Package, and no-cost Summer Tires:$48 MSRP. I know the Audi costs a lot more, but the build quality and interior appointments are SO much better overall, it's very quick, it's nicer to drive on a daily basis, and still very sporty. If you test drive both, you'll figure out very quickly whether the Audi is worth the extra cash..

4720,SkullLeader," Currently own a '15 A3 with the Quattro system and the 220hp engine.  Its a great car all around.  The dual clutch is smooth as silk most of the time but on the rare occasion where it fails to predict the next shift correctly, it gets a little rocky.  Acceleration is also quite good most of the time.  Turbo lag really isn't a thing with it.  Generally the engine is great most of the time it just lacks a little in terms of reserve power when you go to floor it.  Might be pushing it for your budget but if you could get an '15 or later S3 you'll get a fairly good bump in power vs the A3.. If you don't necessarily need the luxury, the VW Golf is built on the same platform etc. and should be less expensive to purchase etc.. Maybe look at the entry level BMW's too.  The wife has a Mercedes CLA250 which is usually seen as a competitor to the A3 and personally I'd give it a pass, at least vs. the Audi.. Also had an '04 G35 coupe, which might not be the best thing to compare to in terms of what sort of infiniti you could get with your budget right now (I'd think G37 at least if not Q50) but even though the A3 is fine in terms of the engine, the G35 was in another league and the G37/Q50 have even more power than that - V6 naturally aspirated vs. V4 turbo and the G35 really never lacked for power in the 10+ years I drove it..

With that kind of budget you could get a new Golf R/Audi S3.  Basically the same car but the golf is a hatch which is a lot more practical and tbh I think has a nicer interior.

4731,hotels_on_atlantic," ""underpowered"" is a relative term (. A subaru without a turbo or H6 is slow, but still acceptable for daily driving, even at elevation. Though if you want a fun to drive subaru, the only option is likely the WRX.. However, as someone living in CO and driving a WRX-type vehicle (lowered S40 T5 AWD), I can tell you a sedan is not very practical for an active lifestyle. It's great fun to drive on smooth pavement, but that's about it. I feel every goddamn bump in the road. It's pretty much trash on anything but maintained pavement or dirt. Terrible option if you want to go even slightly off the beaten path. The other weekend I went camping and smashed my subframe on a rock barely larger than my fist. Besides comfort/GC, space is the other big issue. If you want to fit a mt bike w/out a rack you'll be folding the seats and likely removing both wheels (a huge pain in the ass). Camping with 1 other person and the car is pretty much packed. Good lucking bringing a 3rd person.. That's why I'm looking for wagon w/ 6""+ of clearance as my next vehicle.

4756,MakingTheGrade," I'm in the NYC area, I go back and forth to New Jersey as well as out to Queens. Of course, price should be as low as possible, but not to the point that we begin compromising on other things. I'd say 30 000 is my limit.. I'd prefer to lease, not buy.. I'd prefer an EV, Plug in hybrid, or hybrid. Should be on the bigger side, bigger than a midsize vehicle, to give you an idea. Subcompact SUV for example. Safety features are of great importance, as well as safety ratings.. It's a very restrictive list, I know, which is why I wanted some extra brains/pairs of eyes on this. I've looked at the 2018 Kia Niro PHEV, which I liked other than the fact that it has no crash ratings (that I could find). The price is also a little restrictive, but better with the tax credit anyway. I'd like your opinions on the Kia especially. I've looked at the Tesla Model X but that's way out of my price range. 30 000 is basically my limit. The Toyota RAV4 also seemed good but my friends were instantly sceptical of how 'manly' a car the RAV4 was. I've looked at two smaller cars, the Prius and Honda Accord. They're too small for my liking, but if you can really sell me on them I'll take another look at it. The size preference is a consequence of my comfort (I'm a large guy -- 180 cm, broad shoulders and chest, long legs) also I feel far safer in a larger car. If it's worth taking a second look at either of these or any smaller cars let me know what you have in mind and why.. I just wanted to add that range anxiety isn't huge for me. I'll have lots of opportunities to charge on any given trip. Of course I'll want a longer range vehicle but it's not big for me.. Thanks!.

4763,IKnowNewCars," The C43 is a fantastic choice. Honestly the only downside is that its ride quality is a bit harsh because its suspension is so firm and capable. But if you want a sporty, fun-to-drive sports sedan with a really nice interior, it's very hard to beat for the price.. On the other hand, if you want to go even sportier for a similar price, check out the new Audi RS3. Yes, it's small, but 0-60 in 3.5 seconds is absurdly quick, and its handling is so nimble. It's brand new, so you won't be able to find one used or CPO (probably), but if it works with your budget, it's absolutely worth a test drive..

4769,IKnowNewCars," At the $40k range, you might as well test drive all of them and pick the one you like best. For reference, here's how I would rank the 4 performance compacts you listed, from favorite to least favorite: Civic Type R. Sure, it looks ridiculous, and it's the only FWD example here. But for a car that handles crazy well and has a ton of usable power, it's also the best daily driver of the group (in my opinion). Comfortable interior, surprisingly smooth ride quality, lots of cargo space, etc. You can probably find one for MSRP these days.. Golf R. The level of refinement in VW's nicest vehicles is impressive, and that includes the Golf R. Same engine, drivetrain, and platform as the Audi S3, but with a manual transmission, more practical hatchback body style, and a cheaper price tag. It's also very quick and nimble. For some reason, 2018 models haven't made it to dealers yet, but when they do, they'll be a very solid buy.. Focus RS. The 2018 model is fairly expensive because it includes some packages standard that were optional on the 2017 model, but if you want something truly quick and fun, it delivers. It won't feel as comfortable as the others for daily driving, but it's probably the best track tool of the bunch. It's fast. Ford had an issue with the engine, but it seems they've rectified it.. WRX &amp; WRX STi. They're great cars, don't get me wrong. But they're not as great for daily driving as the others, and they don't come in hatch form anymore. The STi is slower than its competitors for the same price, and while the WRX comes surprisingly close to STi levels of performance, it still suffers from more turbo lag than the others, a less enthusiast-friendly shifter, and a harsh ride quality. Having said that, its AWD system is more robust than its competitors, so if you're gonna be tearing up dirt, gravel, mud, or just driving quicker than you should in bad weather, it may be the best way to go. A WRX in Premium trim with the Performance Package will run $32k MSRP, making it cheaper than any of the other models you're looking at..

Frankly that could very well be the worst financial decision of your life. Why not look at something used or CPO? You can get more car for a lot less money, and you will thank yourself down the road.. My suggestion is get a nice used WRX for $20k or so. You won't see much depreciation on it if you take care of it, and you won't be upside down on a giant car loan. And trust me it will be just as fun as the new one..

4805,IKnowNewCars," The Fiat 500 is a bit improved for 2018 now that the base engine is the 135 HP turbocharged one. But it's still not particularly quick, it's . very.  small, reliability isn't great, etc. If you want something small and cute and quirky and can put up with the less practical bits, don't let me stop you! But apart from the sporty Abarth model, it's hard to give the 500 a real recommendation.. The newly-redesigned Kia Rio, on the other hand, is definitely worth a look, as is the Hyundai Accent, its close relative. They've both got a surprising amount of refinement that's surprising both in terms of price and size. Little cars are usually more fun with manual transmissions, but since the manual Rio only comes with the base model (which doesn't even have power windows), the model really worth checking out is the . Rio 5-door.  (hatchback) in . S.  trim, which comes with an auto transmission. You get a lot for the $17,295 MSRP, and of course that price will come down a bit at the dealership.. If you can give up the hatchback body style, the . Hyundai Accent.  in base . SE.  trim has more equipment than the base Rio, comes with a manual transmission that would be fantastic to learn on, and only costs $15,880 MSRP.. One more worth test driving is the . Toyota Yaris iA.  sedan. Ditch the Yaris hatchback (they're actually built on different bones and the sedan is much better), but give the iA a test drive with a manual transmission and see what you think. There are no trim levels or options, but instead it comes with tons of standard equipment, even active safety features, for $16,845 MSRP.. And lastly:If you want a small, inexpensive hatchback but want better practicality and reliability than the Fiat, test drive a . Chevy Spark.  in . 1LT.  trim with a manual. The MSRP is only $15,750 before incentives, and you get some nice features you wouldn't get on a base model of a bigger car, like Apple Carplay/Android Auto, as well as a surprisingly composed little car..

4812,engwish," Location:San Francisco, CA. Simple question, I am looking for a second commuter car. My budget is &lt;10k.. I came across a used dealer selling a 2005 Camry with 31k miles for $9k. It‚Äôs in mint condition. Clean title. Carfax has single owner who only drove like 2.5k miles per year.. It has two minor issues I caught during test drive:needs a slight alignment and the pedal feels a tad rough during idle.. Pending a pre-inspection, is the price worth it?

If they're going to insist on a price above market but the car is clean and low mileage it may be worthwhile but I would have them do an alignment before signing and solving any other issues it has.. Sounds like it may not be so clean beneath the surface though so be ready to walk away. Used car dealers, sadly, have reputations for covering up rather than fixing..

4833,Skeet__Skeet," They tend to have run flat tires which are almost all garbage if you‚Äôre looking for grip in the twisties but fine for commuting. I‚Äôm honestly not sure if all of them use run flats now or if that‚Äôs just from the e9x generation, worth looking into since they didn‚Äôt give the 1 series a spare (not sure if this was specific to 1ers or everything else). I have aftermarket wheels and get my tires off tire rack and have them shipped to my house or a local installer, never had an issue finding a great tire for a reasonable price but it might be challenging if you‚Äôre only looking at run flats.. As for maintenance, the engines are solid but all the plastic things attached to them can break if not maintained properly but the most expensive issues have typically been taken care of by recalls (for n54 engines, high pressure fuel pump, turbos, and injectors are the big ones). They still use plastic impellers on their water pumps which tend to go at 100k but VW and Audi do the same, part of the reason the 100k service includes water pump, timing belt, and thermostat. Using a site like fcpeuro will save you a boat load of money for repairs and everything they sell, including clutches, come with a lifetime warranty.. If you do the work yourself, can follow DIYs, and are able to take care of the car then it‚Äôs totally worth the price of admission and ongoing costs. Not insane but not cheap. If you‚Äôd rather have a basic appliance car Honda/Acura or Toyota/lexus will get you 80% of the fun and be less of a headache.. Having a used German car is like taking care of a child, it can be a pain in the ass sometimes, can get expensive if you don‚Äôt pay attention or put in the effort up front, and will ruin your life if you abuse it. But if you‚Äôre ok with taking care of something more than a cat or dog the experience can be much more rewarding.. I say that as a huge fan of dogs and kids but never having raised either so take that with a grain of salt. Also, don‚Äôt buy the badge. No one cares what you drive any more than the clothes you wear so make sure you enjoy whatever it is you choose and that you‚Äôre making the decision for yourself..

Looking for something that says I'm late 20's rather than this is my car until I'm 40 (I'm 33 right now). Commute will be 16 miles on highway and 2 miles on surface streets each way.  All errands are within 1 mile of my house so I probably will only use my car to buy groceries everything else I'll still walk.  Not going to finance, looking to pay cash.. My main question is: Is there a ""technology jump"" for certain companies?  Like my best example that I can say is ""Before Parallel parking assist and after parallel parking assist"" or progression of ""Cassette player -&gt; cd player -&gt; cd changer -&gt; satellite radio -&gt; in car wifi for Pandora/Spotify"". My newest car was '04, so the most I know about ""new technology"" is what I see in my ubers, and my brother's Tesla when I went to see him in February (Which is fucking insane).  I got a cutting edge car that had an XM tuner built in (that offset shark fin looking thing on the roof)  I don't think it even had a low tire air pressure light.... So my car range would be: ""Still in college"" - Civic to ""This car will be my car until I'm 40"" - BMW Z3. My actual amazing car (which fits nothing into my profile) would be a Honda Element.  And my anti-car would be a Prius (just because they've become so common that all the taxi/uber drivers are driving them)  I want a unique car that people will see and say ""Oh shit, that's IONTOP"" while not being a pretentious douchebag about it..

4900,IKnowNewCars," Cool! That helps a bit. I'll focus on new cars, because other folks here will have more useful advice for you on used cars. The Grand Cherokee SRT and Durango SRT are both a bit out of your budget new, and sadly they don't have any real direct competitors. You could always deck out a regular Grand Cherokee with some really nice options and get pretty close for cheaper! a Grand Cherokee Summit 4x4 w/ the 5.7L Hemi V8 would stay just under $60k and would include everything you could ask for in a Grand Cherokee, from off-road ability, to a really nice interior, to a big-ass Hemi. If you want to save some cash, the High Altitude trim w/ the V8 and optional Quadro-Drive II 4WD system would come out to $56k MSRP, only sacrificing some features you probably don't need vs the Summit.. If you can work with something a bit smaller than a Grand Cherokee, it might be worth checking out the Ford Edge Sport. Its 315 HP twin-turbo V6 gets it from 0-60 in 5.6 seconds, and its suspension is surprisingly nimble for its size. Opt for Equipment Group 401A for navigation and other nice features (and I'd also add the 19"" wheels and summer tires, if you really want a good time with all that power), and your MSRP still stays under $48k (before Ford incentives and dealer discounts).. Looking at the luxury side, there are a few 6-cyl options that just barely fit in your budget and are worth a good look. In particular, the Audi Q7 with its 3.0T powertrain has a 333 HP supercharged V6 that runs 0-60 in 5.5 seconds, while providing a very luxurious experience even in base trim. I'd test drive a Q7 3.0T with the Navigation Plus package, which barely scrapes under your $60k budget maximum.. On the other hand, if you truly want a fast, fun crossover/SUV, you can always go a bit smaller! Maybe a Porsche Macan S would be perfect. 340 HP twin-turbo V6, helping you hit 0-60 in 5.1 seconds. If you go light on options, adding only the Navigation module, you'll stay under $60k and have as close as you can get to a sports crossover in your price range.. Or, for something completely different, you can try the Mercedes-AMG GLA45 (375 HP turbo 4-cyl, 0-60 in 4.0 seconds) or GLC43 (362 HP twin-turbo V6, 0-60 in 4.5 seconds), both of which scrape in under your maximum price too!.

I understand your a new car guy, so thanks for looking into all of that for me. It sucks that there are not direct competitors to the Grand Cherokee because I like the size and shape of it very much and, being a big aesthetics guy, works really well with tint, black accents, black rims (not sure if that is frowned upon on this sub or not)..

4902,IKnowNewCars," Keep in mind, when I say ""no direct competitors,"" I meant to the Grand Cherokee SRT and Dodge Durango SRT, not to the normal Cherokee and Durango. Most folks just aren't interested in a $70k mid-size SUV with the same engine as the Challenger Scat Pack. FYI, the High Altitude trim of the Grand Cherokee does have those black rims and accents you're looking for, as well as tinted rear windows, so I bet a High Altitude 4x4 V8 model will best approximate what you're looking for within your price range..

4907,shazam_7," I'd consider a 2018 Mazda 6.. They just introduced turbo if you're into that, the car has some really nice leather interior trims which rival a lot of luxury cars, and in blue/black the car is (imo) really beautiful... It doesn't have the badge prestige of something else, which is a fair thing to want if you do. But it's under your budget by a decent amount which means you could fill up the trims and options to your leisure.. They're also very reliable and (said to be) fun to drive with solid mileage. There's something to be said about a nice, solidly luxurious car that's fairly cheap to own.. So it might be a good idea to come in under budget with a car that hits the marks.. But for your price range and broad criteria, more than anything just go get in some cars. You'll find one who's look, interior and overall vibe talk to you more than the others.. Seems like you just want to be comfy and feel good. Those things are very subjective- so just go try stuff out..

4908,IKnowNewCars," If your reason for getting a bigger car is just so that you fit comfortably, I'd pass on an SUV/crossover. An A4 sounds like a great option, honestly. You might get a slightly larger interior with a mid-size sedan from a non-luxury brand (think Honda Accord, Mazda 6, etc), but if you test drive it and like the feel of the interior and the seats, I think it would be a great balance of luxury and sporty driving character. Audi's reliability has also been much improved over the last 5 years or so, compared to 10-15 years ago when they ran into lots of problems.. Opt for an A4 Quattro w/ the 252 HP engine. I'd test out a Premium trim model w/ 18"" wheels, no-cost summer tires, and the Sport package. MSRP w/ delivery comes out to $43k, but you can probably knock that down a bit. It's an honestly good deal for a well-balanced luxury sports sedan.. Skip the CLA. Mainly because its interior is fairly cramped, but second, it sacrifices a . lot.  compared to the C-class in order to be offered at a decent price. If you want something similar in size that's a higher quality vehicle, try out the Audi A3 Quattro.. The Wrangler is certainly an outlier, but I get why people love it:unbeatable off-road prowess, cool looks, getting the Jeep Wave from other Wranglers on the road. If you're interested in actually going off-road on the weekends, it could be an awesome purchase. Just keep in mind that its on-road manners are definitely low-brow compared to an Audi luxury sedan.

4959,Maknoz," Long story short, I am an 18 years old student from Norway and I'll graduate Highschool in about two weeks. After that I'll head of to university ca. 1 hour away from where my parents live. My beloved Peugeot 207CC hard-top convertible suffered a critical roof-mechanism failure in April after only one year of ownership. The car is a 2007 mod. and was partly a birthday present from my parents. Back then we spent $7000 on it.. After having spent a lot of money and many sleepless nights without any luck I am serioulsy considering to just sell the car in it's current state. Selling it now would break my heart, however it would also yield me approximately $4000.. Since I have been obsessed with cars ever since I went to kindergarden and I absolutely love the freedom that owning a car has given me the next logical step is of course to look for a replacement. I am more than willing to spend the $4000 on a replacement, however I really want my new car to be as reliable as possible after all the extreme maintaince-costs that I had to pay over the last months. (Remember I am only a student). After looking for possible deals in my area I stumbled upon two or tree cars that I am interested in, however many of them are quite old. Now my question is, . What is more important, mileage or age of the car?. Let's for example say I would by a Mitsubishi Carisma 2003. mod for barely $2900 that has been ownd by an eldry couple and only has a little over 30 000 miles (50 000 km for fellow europeans). The mileage is pretty low, but I have serious doubts about buying a 15 years old car..   . What should I be looking for if I want something to safely get me through 5 years of university?. Thanks in advance!. Location:Norway, around Oslo. Price range:25 000 to 50 000 NOK, $2500 to $5000. Lease or Buy:Buy. New or used:Used. Type of vehicle:Anything, would like a Sedan or Coupe.

4969,Orian3030," Ram or Ford...my 94 Jeep (from H.S.) is slowly dying :. Located in Utah/Idaho. Contender 1- 2016 Ford Ecoboost (3.5), with 48K miles (about $28K). Contender 2- 2017 Ram with Hemi (5.7), with 15K miles (about $28K). Both similar in cab and bed size, similar sized wheels and amenities.. Pros to Contender 1- Ecoboost engine, aftermarket wheels look nice, I like the Ford styling a little better, quieter. Pros to Contender 2- nice engine sound, smoother ride, I like the interface of the stereo/infotainment better, less miles/newer. Needs:I drive very few miles each day during the school year, about 10 miles total each day. In the summer I would be hauling two kiddos in the truck and working on some bigger house projects. Hence, the need for a truck. I am also looking into finally building on our cabin lot. Both trucks feel super fast and powerful, I won't be doing super heavy towing. I will be towing some smaller trailers/boats around 4K lbs at the max. Both trucks are located at dealers about two hours from my house...in opposite directions. I have driven very similar trucks at another dealer closer to home. What say you? Thank you for your comments, this has been a hard time...I still like my old Jeep, but I can't spend anymore time or money on it..

4978,IKnowNewCars," The current RDX is fine, nothing exceptional and not my favorite for the price. You'd get more for your money by decking out a Honda CR-V in the upper trim levels (EX-L and Touring in the US). Having said that, the RDX getting redesigned in 2019 and looks like it could be an improvement.. The two I mentioned in the two-row mid-size category aren't great on safety, failing to get IIHS Top Safety Pick awards this year due to imperfect front crash ratings. The Mazda CX-9 could be a really good bet:it's an IIHS Top Safety Pick in its upper trim levels (Grand Touring and Signature trims include curve-adaptive LED headlights that bump up its safety rating). It also has one of the nicest interiors of any non-luxury 3-row crossover. If you don't use the 3rd row, you can keep it folded down and enjoy a lot of cargo space with a spacious 2nd row. On top of all that, it's actually enjoyable to drive, which is tough to find once you get into that size category.. On the luxury side, the Audi Q5, BMW X3, Mercedes-Benz GLC300, and Volvo XC60 are all solid crossovers with great crash test ratings, though they're all a bit more expensive than the Acura RDX. Another worth considering might be the Lexus NX300, which is an IIHS Top Safety Pick with no extra options added (though I recommend trying out the F Sport version, with its incredibly comfortable sport seats). It's on the small side, but the price is right!. ",Sub_Content, 19 days ago,t1_dzyyo8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8mpb92/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

4991,IKnowNewCars," First thing's first:the RS3 is amazing. Test drive it and you'll see what I mean. If the size meets your practicality needs, it could make an amazing sporty daily driver. 0-60 in 3.5 seconds is no joke, and talk about nimble handling. And the exhaust note! I could go on and on about it.. The S5 Sportback would certainly be a more practical choice, and it's pretty quick too (0-60 in 4.3 seconds), as well as capable, comfortable, etc. But it has a few more imperfections. Next to the likes of BMW and Mercedes, steering feel is pretty isolated, and the variable steering on the S5 isn't always precise and predictable. More understeer as well. All in all, it doesn't feel as fun and engaging as you'd hope. But it's certainly capable, it looks great, it's very comfortable, and the hatchback is practical.. Sadly, the 4-series Gran Coupe isn't as thrilling as you'd hope either. The twin-turbo straight-6 in the 440i is awesome and sounds great, and a rear-biased AWD system makes corners more fun, it seems even more isolated than the S5 at times, with little steering feel and little desire for the driver to push the car farther. Choosing between the 440i Gran Coupe and S5 Sportback will come down to personal preference.. But my money would actually be on the Kia Stinger GT if I really wanted a sportback in that price range. The amount of fun and performance you get for the money is fantastic. It can't quite hit the S5 and 440i in terms of luxury, refinement, and track-ready handling, but it gets very close in every category for thousands of dollars less. It can also run 0-60 in 4.6 seconds, a bit slower than the Audi but faster than the BMW. And the 365 HP twin-turbo V6 sounds . very.  good. I'm not sure what the trim levels are like in Canada, but if you don't get the top-of-the-line decked-out model, at least make sure you get one with adaptive dampers if possible.. My only other recommendation would be, if you're open to sedans rather than sportbacks, check out the Alfa Romeo Giulia. It's hard to explain why, but it's just one of the most enjoyable sports sedans on the market when it comes to driving experience. It just is. You've gotta test drive it to get what I mean. I'd go for a Ti model add the Performance Package. It's not gonna be as quick as the others, but there's something special about it, if you're into that sort of thing..

4992,turbobk1," Thank you for the insight, I failed to mention I have already test driven the RS3, S4, S5 sportback, and 440i gran coupe. Out of those I enjoyed the overall package of the S5 sportback the most, but going into it I was expecting more from the RS3 based on all the reviews. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it was a fantastic car, made all the right sounds and looks fantastic - but the S4/S5 felt a bit more refined down low and the interior is much better besides the steering wheel and shifter. The 440i was also a great drive, but the interior felt cheap for a 70k car optioned out.. Overall the massage seats alone on the S5 sportback are a big deal for my 1+ hour commute home in stop and go traffic. Combined with the low end torque and smooth 8 speed slushbox (really thought I would enjoy the 7 speed DCT in the RS3 more) it makes for a great all around daily, and the hatch allows easy loading of tools for work. Another disappointment in the RS3 was the non existent trunk space, I was expecting more considering the hatchback variant has a respectable amount of space in the rear..

5000,BlueBell_IceCream," I‚Äôll definitely advocate for the wagon!. Most professional car reviews you come across mention the Subaru Crosstrek.  This is a very good wagon. At bare minimum, it meets your requirements:good cargo space, optional leather, Apple/android multimedia compatibility, and decent gas mileage.  Personally though, it would not be my first wagon choice.  The Crosstrek is geared towards the outdoor adventure types.  The interior is best described as basic.  Non-luxury auto companies choose the cheapest interior materials for off road vehicles.   My assumption is due to ease of cleaning and replacement.  With the Crosstrek, you must sacrifice comfort for off-road handling capability.. I‚Äôd say the best two wagon daily drivers are the Volkswagen Alltrack and the Buick Tour X.. The Alltrack marries the quality VW interior with style, cargo, and connectivity. This vehicle is also one of the few to offer a manual transmission, but only on the lower trim. Some reviewers have knocked the vehicle for feeling underpowered at highway speeds and a harsh suspension.  Supposedly, the suspension issue can be fixed with smaller factory rims, but there‚Äôs no fixing the ‚Äúunderpowered‚Äù engine without voiding the warranty.. Finally, the Buick Regal Tour X is the flashy new kid on the block.  It‚Äôs the fastest of the bunch, best looking, huge cargo capacity, and most comfortable.  The vehicle was designed to compete directly against luxury German wagons.  All things considered, the Tour X falls short of meeting the interior quality of any Audi, handling of a BMW, or luxury experience of a Mercedes.  This is definitely not a bad thing, because all of these vehicles are priced well above the Tour X.  Buick had made huge strides with this wagon and it comes extremely close to luxury level at an affordable price.. I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúGet the Buick!‚Äù.

5002,IKnowNewCars," If you currently have an Accord and like the amount of cabin space offered by the Optima, you probably want to stick with a mid-size option. The Accord is always a favorite, and the 2018 model is even better than usual. If I was gonna buy an Accord, it would definitely be the Accord Sport 2.0T manual, which is definitely the most fun to drive, includes Android Auto, Apple Carplay, and active safety features, with an MSRP of $31k. The downside is no leather, of course. If that's a must have, the EX-L 2.0T model with an auto transmission is $32k and offers everything you'd want, along with that quick 2.0T engine (performance is on par with the V6 in 2017 and earlier models).. The Mazda 6 is probably the Accord's biggest competition right now in that vein, with another great 2018 redesign and a new turbocharged engine. The Grand Touring Reserve trim is very comparable to the Accord EX-L 2.0T and is worth a look. Android Auto isn't included yet, but Mazda is apparently in talks to add it, and that could mean a software update is added to your car after your purchase when it becomes available. You can talk to a Mazda dealership and see how likely that is.. The VW Golf Sportwagen would be a great solution as well, offering more cargo flexibility, a fun driving experience, and a manual transmission, though you would be giving up some cabin room compared to the mid-size options. The only bummer is that real leather seats aren't available, only V-Tex, VW's leatherette option. It's nice, but you'll have to judge whether it feels up to par. I would actually recommend that you check out the VW Golf Alltrack SE w/ a manual transmission, which comes out to $31k and should offer everything you're looking for. VW longevity isn't exactly noted, but they do offer a 6 year/72k mile bumper-to-bumper warranty on all 2018 models, so that offers a bit of peace of mind!. With the GTI, you take the Sportwagen/Alltrack, give up the extra cargo space, and add a fantastic engine, suspension, and driving experience. There's no other car that strikes the balance of fun, refinement, and practicality for the money. But it's not gonna be . as.  practical as a wagon, depending on your needs. You'll want to test drive a GTI SE manual w/ the optional leather seats, MSRP $32k..

5009,asdfvtn," I got some cars in mind so I'll be deviating off the suggestion list if that's okay.. Country:Canada. Budget:30k. Considering:Civic, Impreza, Golf [hatchbacks]. What would you go for? Thanks for the help!. ",Main_Content, 22 days ago,t1_dzxredq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8mpb92/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/
5010,IKnowNewCars," If I wasn't considering winter driving, here's my general ranking of those three cars: Golf. It's just a great car. It does pretty much everything well and is just a pleasure to drive. Reliability is lower than the Civic and Impreza, but VW's offering a 6 year/72k mile bumper-to-bumper warranty on all 2018 models (at least in the US they are, I'm guessing in Canada too), so that mitigates that.. Civic. The current gen Civic hatch has an awesome chassis paired to a great engine and suspension. Personally, I think the best version of it is the Civic Sport with a manual transmission, which makes good on its Sport badge by offering a quicker steering ratio, a sportier engine tune with more power and torque, and a great shifter. But even non-sport CVT versions are well built, fun to drive, fuel efficient, practical, etc.. The Impreza does a lot of things well:it's safe, pretty reliable, comfortable, efficient, inexpensive, and of course has standard symmetrical AWD. But its powertrain is its biggest letdown:the 2.0L flat-4 is slow and lacks usable torque, the CVT is not great at squeezing out that power and torque, and the 5-speed manual is one of the least fun shift-for-yourself transmissions on the road, sadly. But as the only compact with AWD, it sort of sits in a class by itself. As a side note, if you can drive manual, getting a Crosstrek with the new 6-speed manual is a much more enjoyable driving experience and is otherwise very similar to the Impreza hatch.. Regarding winter weather:Tires make a bigger difference than drivetrain for most people. AWD can help you maintain traction when starting from a stop, or get you unstuck when you need it, but if you're on a potentially slippery highway, the difference between AWD and FWD becomes less pronounced. On the other hand, winter tires will help you grip the road when turning on slippery roads or at low temperatures. If you have the means to swap in winter tires and swap them out when it warms back up, I'd say FWD is probably fine. But that depends on whether you like the Golf or Civic that much more than the Impreza.. Test drive them all!.

5011,2tonez," Between the three you're considering? New or used?  Similarly to you, I live in Canada. I believe the Impreza is the only one between those that have AWD. That's something to consider if you get lots of snow in your area. Personally I'm not into the Golf, just the look of it, but otherwise a great car. As far as performance goes, Honda and VW. Something like the Civic sport Hatchback with the 1.5 turbo could be a good option. There's also the GTI and Civic Si which are +30k vehicles. As for practicality in Canada, the Impreza might be worth it during winter season. There's also the Crosstrek, which is essentially a lifted Impreza. With a meaty set of tires they look pretty bad ass.. ",Sub_Content, 22 days ago,t1_dzxredq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8mpb92/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

Plain and simple I was tired of getting stuck in the snow and sliding around during bad weather.

5021,IKnowNewCars," With a decent amount of city traffic included there, a hybrid would end up being rather economical. The Prius and Accord Hybrid are both solid options, with the Accord being my preference for interior comfort and overall driving experience. Other options to consider include the Toyota Camry hybrid, Hyundai Ioniq, and Kia Niro. Another interesting choice to try might be the Chevy Cruze Diesel, which gets 47 MPG highway without any electrification or hybrid motors. And if you end up wanting to stick with a traditional gas car, I'd say the Toyota Camry SE is a good starting point, since its 2.5L engine kicks butt in its class with 34 combined MPG (it's rated for 41 MPG highway, and some real-world tests have beaten that by a good amount).. I'd test drive some of these and see what you think. The size differences, as well as the differences in how they drive, will give you some insight into which ones you'll be happiest driving for 15k miles a year.

5060,IKnowNewCars," BMW is always going to be expensive to repair out of warranty, though for the past few years their expected reliability ratings have gone up. Audi is a similar story, though I'd say cost-to-own is lower than BMW on average. Subaru's reliability is better than average but not great by Japanese standards, though repairs out of warranty will be less expensive than nearly any luxury brand.. The Outback does exactly what it advertises (no more, no less), but it does it well. It's spacious, comfortable, efficient (with the base engine), all-weather capable and good off road, very safe, etc. Its downsides are mostly in regard to the driving experience:dynamically it feels boring on the road, the base engine feels low on torque, and the CVT doesn't help the situation. The more powerful 3.6R engine is quicker and more torque-y, but not by a huge amount, and fuel economy suffers a bit.. Unfortunately, there aren't many wagons and wagon-style crossovers for sale in North America (at least not compared to the usual crossovers), but the Outback has some solid competitors, especially if your budget range is flexible. My favorite is the Audi A4 Allroad, which is basically an A4 sedan, stretched into a wagon, and lifted a bit like a crossover. The best part is that it drives like an A4, making it quite a bit more exciting than an Outback. The Allroad's only engine option is way quicker than even the Outback's faster engine, and way more efficient. The transmission is MUCH better. The interior materials and infotainment are awesome. Its only downsides compared to the Outback are that the interior is smaller, it's not quite as off-road capable, and it's more expensive. Consider test driving an A4 Allroad in Premium Plus trim (nice balance of features and value), and add the Cold Weather package for those Pennsylvania winters, bringing the MSRP to $49k. The Navigation and Telematics package is worth the $3000 upcharge for Audi Virtual Cockpit (an awesome configurable gauge cluster), as well as a nicer screen and navigation, if it fits in your budget.. Other great wagon choices are out there at many price points too, including the Volkswagen Golf Alltrack, Volvo V60, Volvo V90, and the BMW 330i Sports Wagon.. If you'd rather look at the more traditional crossover choices out there, your options open up fast. If you can give us more info about your wants and needs (how much cargo space do you want, do you want sporty or cushy or a blend of both, etc), we can help you narrow those down a bit more..

5086,Ze_S_Z," Few things to consider:ownership cost, depreciation, and enjoyment.. 1st for interior, I would not suggest light or site interiors. They get dirty too fast. Cannot wear scratchy jeans or anything jagged.. As for the vehicles you mentioned, a used Cayman 981 would be lower depreciation than the rest so cost of ownership speaking it's the better investment., I'm not being biased, I bought it brad new for that reason. The BMWs are going to depreciate like bricks because they have high production amounts and aren't as desirable. The Z4 won't as much but in my area the Cayman holds value the most due to the new Caymans having a flat 4 engine instead of flat 6 howl. It is also the best cornering and exotic out of the bunch (I've driven every car you've listed), the drive feels much more like a experience rather than just a sport car.. If it were up to me, I would only consider the Z4 and the Cayman.

5088,Ze_S_Z," Stingray is a completely different car. It a lot heavier and more horsepower. It's also got a very long wheel base and is a very large car compared to the Z4 and Cayman. They handle extremely different. The Cayman and Z4 is more of a happy little puppy (comparatively speaking), that can go and respond whenever you turn the wheel instantly. The Stingray is more business, I'd argue much harder to drive fast especially if this is your first car. I wouldn't do it because if this is your first car you'd likely get in trouble.... The Cayman and the Z4 has a lot of refinement and balance, which also means it's drastically harder for you to F up because the weight transfer and handling is so neutral and centred (and Cayman more so than the Z4 since it is mid engine, although understeers a little, it means more safety for you and generally faster track times if you are going to race them, and likely achieve the fastest time out of the three cars assuming you aren't a professional race car driver).. As for interior being red, that I do like, but I personally always didn't give a crap about interiors and always pick the one that's most durable and easy to clean or maintain. Anything bright is hard to maintain and will require time or money that im not willing to spend.. And there is a lot more incentive to by a 2016 or older Cayman within the 981 generation as they are the last engine with the flat 6 and had a very limited run with low quantity produced (not 3 years of production, super super short), meaning they are rarer and hold value more and are the last naturally breathing engines Porsche will make in a non-GT series car, (which many enthusiasts desire). The new Caymans have a 4 banger with a very controversial sound that isn't very liked by the community (not saying it's a bad car, I'm just stating a fact), but has more performance and will provide better track records when you race, but does not have the sweet exotic soundtrack that's on par with supercars (I've had a lot of experience too, and IMO it sounds better than certain supercars by far), it was considered the best sounding car for its money. The new 718 Caymans also depreciate more in comparison to the 981 caymans for that engine reason. But just slightly.. So they are all VERY different vehicles.. Objectively and factually speaking, buying a used 981 Cayman is the best choice because they win in the depreciation department, they are just as good in looks as a Stingrays if not better depending if you like edgy cool looking cars versus slim elegant designs ( I swing both ways). It also has plenty of performance in its league (so let's say comparib with the Z4). It is also a 2013 announcement car where as Z4 is almost a decade old car.. As for the 3 and 4 series. They aren't sports cars. More so family cars. Even M3 and M4 are comfortable sport compact saloons these days, not sports cars. So if you want something much less hardcore and has 5 comfy seats then go for this option it be prepared to take the depreciation.. Lastly and most importantly, we all say we will keep our first car forever, but we don't I can guarantee that you will not drive this car for more than 5 or 6 years at most.  I was the same, thought I'd keep my first car forever, spent all my thoughts into convincing that it would be the case, didn't happen at all. Meaning, unless you don't care about the money at all, you should still care about the depreciation aspect of a car. .. I may sound a little biased towards the 981 but I guarantee you it is not because I care about Porsche. It's simply the best choice logically out of the bunch. BUT car buying isn't always logical so go where your heart takes you. It just happens for me, that's where my wallet is üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ.

Id rather get white with red interior than like red exterior with black interior. However, lime green lambo is a different thing.... I really like the cayman but I think I like the z4 look a little more not to mention it's a hard top convertible. Speaking of which, I know you say I probably won't keep the car when the time comes but the reason I think I will is cause it's a hard top convertible which there aren't much of so it's pretty useful.

Just keep in mind the Z5 is coming very soon and it likely cause the Z4 to depreciate a lot more than usual. But that's at least another year away, so I'd say if you feel that Z4 IS THE ONE, go for it! Especially since you don't care about depreciation, I say the enjoyment aspect you won't be disappointed..

5144,IKnowNewCars," If you're OK with a sedan rather than a hatchback, my recommendation would definitely be the Toyota Yaris iA. It's an entirely different model than the Yaris hatchback. The iA is actually built by Mazda and is sold elsewhere in the world as the Mazda 2, and up until 2016 it was sold as the Scion iA in the US (and Canada as well, I presume). There's only one trim level and it includes a ton of standard features for the price, as well as a surprisingly enjoyable driving experience, solid manual transmission, and comfortable interior. You won't get Apple Carplay, but that's tough to get in this price range anyway.. To get Apple Carplay and a more flexible cargo area/hatchback, check out the Honda Fit EX. It's gonna be a bit more expensive than the iA, and maybe not as refined, but it's still enjoyable to drive and fairly comfortable.. The Spark may be the smallest of the group, but if it meets your needs, it's actually great for the price. The 1LT manual trim comes with Apple Carplay and a few other nice features for a very cheap price, yet it doesn't feel like a cheap, flimsy car, especially next to its direct competitors (a hockey fan might call them ""penalty boxes""). If you want cheap, the Spark is the way to go, but the Fit and Yaris iA are both worth the money too. Test drive them and pick the one you like best, or the one you get the best deal on!.

5157,IKnowNewCars," For a safe, reliable SUV for a college student, the place to start is IIHS, who awards Top Safety Picks each year to vehicles that meet certain safety requirements. They get stricter each year, so a 2018 Top Safety Pick is even safer on average than one for 2017, for example.. If you look closely at the list, you'll see the only SUV that wins the IIHS Top Safety Pick this year with a trim level in your price range is the Mazda CX-5 Sport. Each CX-5 comes standard with city speed automated front crash prevention, as well as very safe LED headlights and great crash test scores. The base MSRP is $25k before dealer discounts. Luckily, the CX-5 is also well built, reliable, comfortable, and enjoyable to drive without enough power to get your son in any trouble. It's a very well rounded car and definitely gets my recommendation.

5212,memesarelife2000," with that budget and for your intended use, Toyota (corolla/camry) and Honda (civic/accord) should be your priority -as they established themselves as the most reliable and cheap on maintenance. Additionally, they are fuel efficient as well, so you will save driving for Uber, etc.  Assuming that your budget is TAXES extra, you should have no problems finding a reasonably priced car with reasonable mileage, see trader.ca website. Toyotas a bit boring and (trims) options are limited, Honda (Civic) on other end has more to choose from to suite your style and preferences. Since it's your first time buying, if buying privately (not from dealers) make sure you have someone who knows cars (mechanic?) test/see/check the car before making any payments. Don't be afraid to walk away if you feel something is fishy or not right, no matter if buying from dealer or privately, remember YOU are the one with $$$. Also, consider NISSAN (Altima). I am not familiar with Hyundai/Kia, but so far they have good track record (recent year models) but, your budget is limiting to older models. Mazda's are pretty cheap, but I haven't figured it out yet why, Mazda's does have some spotty record, rusting and transmission problems come to mind. Make sure to do your research on your chosen make/model, especially read up on transmission problems/issues, CVTs are still not as robust as normal Automatic Transmissions, you don't want to buy a car and end up having to replace/repair the transmission, it is expensive. Lastly, since we Ontarians being hosed by the insurance companies, I would recommend getting some quotes from your insurance broker/agent before committing to a chosen car. Good Luck..

Do you have any insurance companies you would recommend? What do they require in order to provide a quote?. I'm primarily looking at dealers as private sales are definitely intimidating. I've heard that I should get written quotes from dealers and bring them to other dealers to get the best deal, but is that just for new cars?. EDIT:Also what do you think about Buick?.

5214,memesarelife2000," you're welcome, I myself is looking to purchase as well. Mileage should not be a priority for your budget, some cars/models could drive 300,000kms which is normal for Toyota/Honda(Japanese) cars and still be at reasonable state of repair. Some could be already having problems before hitting 175-200K kms, even with major components transmission/engine, etc. That is why research is paramount looking for key problem areas and addressing them accordingly. Ask around, insurance brokers/agency should give you a range of options, remember they are paid by the companies NOT you(clients). My current insurance is with Wawanessa Insurance but they deal only through a broker not directly with client(s). Call your insurance agent/broker they will ask what is necessary to get you a quote, usually your D.O.B, license type and number, where you live, spousal status, etc. You could negotiate like that but I do not believe dealers will provide such things (quotes in writing) for your budget area car(s).

5223,Stuckinwell," Don't bother with either of the suggestions from that first reply, they're god-awful ideas. The CLA is a MB only in name and has little value as a driver's car. The C63 AMG on the other hand, is an incredible vehicle (with nowhere near your MPG request, lol) but you have to budget much higher than asking price on account of expensive repairs incurred by aging AMGs.. You're looking for a 4-6cyl vehicle with a decent drive and some level of sexiness. Try a BMW 2-series. They're built on a different platform than the 3 series, which sheds some of the reliability issues, and they're fun to drive. If you can afford the I6 engine, then you'll get it because it's the perfect amount of power for the car.. If you want cushy over sporty, a MB C-class can probably be had in your price range with 4 cylinders. Get the least worn one you can because they tend to get expensive with age.. Alternatively, there are some economy brand cars that are worthy of mention. The Kia Optima is a solid sedan with decent kick if you get the SX.

5224,ohnoimrunningoutofsp," Do you prefer straight line speed or handling. Or do you just want something sporty ish looking, kinda quick, and care more about interior? Most of your requirements, even having a turbo, are pretty tame, so I feel like you need to narrow down your search a bit.. Want something more unique? Subtle? Or turn heads? I feel like you don't need that speed and don't want american, but at 30k usd or even less, you can get like a 2016 mustang GT that they haven't been able to move off the lot..

5250,IKnowNewCars," Let's go through the cars you mentioned,  starting with the M3, the quintessential performance sedan. If you love to drive, the M3 is never a bad choice. BMW knows how to make a mean twin-turbo straight-6 engine, and either transmission choice is great. 0-60 in 4.0 seconds ain't bad. Having said that, BMW has lost a bit of its edge in the past few years. Even the M3 doesn't feel quite as engaging and pure as it used to, and the steering feedback is a bit muted. The ride is firm, but probably fine for most driving enthusiasts, even on long hauls.. Personally, I'd pick the C63 over the M3 right now. The twin-turbo V8 makes a bit more power than the M3's straight-6, hitting 0-60 in about the same 4.0 seconds. But the chassis and handling are just so in tune with the road, and the steering is precise and has great feedback. You feel connected with the car, but at the same time the interior is more luxurious than the M3's. The downside is the firm ride. Every road imperfection is felt in the cabin; then again, if the highways you drive on are nicely paved, you'll probably have a comfortable trip with the well-bolstered seats. And if you want more power, there's nothing stopping you from picking the C63 S, but you'd be paying $30k more for a 0.1 second shorter 0-60 time and an even firmer ride, so I'd stick with the C63.. The rest of your considered vehicles are bigger (and more comfortable by default), while sacrificing a bit of performance compared to the M3 and C63. In my opinion, the M550i is the disappointment of the bunch. Sure, it's fast (0-60 in 3.8 seconds) and luxurious (it better be, for $75k), but it misses out on the M part of its M550i badge. You really don't feel as engaged as you'd hope to in a sporty BMW. The main problems are the almost numb steering and extra weight. On the bright side, its ride quality is great, feeling soft enough that highway cruising is a breeze. You just wish it was more like the M240i compared to the M2:90% of the performance, almost all of the driving engagement. The M550i misses that second part.. But this is exactly where the E43 shines. You weren't sure whether to lean more towards performance or luxury? Pick the E43 and get both. Its twin-turbo V6 makes 396 HP and runs 0-60 in 4.2 seconds. It may not be as fast as an M550i, but driving the E43 is a fantastic experience. The precise and responsive steering, excellent handling, well-tuned chassis, it's all there. I think its standard air suspension is one of its main advantages, very well done so that you can switch between impressive corner carving and soft highway comfort. And the interior is fantastic. The E43 is my recommendation.  for your particular situation, since it provides just the right blend of sport and luxury.. The Audi S6 leans in the direction of the BMW M550i, possibly more so:its performance is awesome, with a twin-turbo V8 helping it to run 0-60 in 3.9 seconds and impressive cornering for its size, but it's much better at isolating you from excitement than putting you right in it. If your priority is comfort and luxury, it's certainly the way to go, and it'll get you where you need to go very quickly, but it's missing the spark that the E43 has when it comes to driving engagement.. I know that was a lot of information, but I hope it was helpful! It sounds to me like you're the ideal buyer for an E43, so that's where I'd start if I were you. Enjoy!.

5259,IKnowNewCars," When you consider high reliability and low cost of maintenance, Lexus certainly comes to mind. It's just a bummer that the GS 350 F Sport isn't a sportier car for $60k. It certainly fits your dad's GT car ideals with a comfortable, spacious, well-insulated interior. But for the price, it's slow, has less than ideal handling, and is just not very exciting to drive. As a car enthusiast, it's hard for me to give it a high recommendation, but since your dad's priorities are probably different than mine, I'd say it's definitely worth a test drive.. This is a category the Germans have mostly cornered, with the Mercedes E-class offering the best balance of luxury and sport. But with a better reputation for reliability, the Audi A6 is another you should consider for your dad. Its interior is very nice, its exterior gives off a very refined vibe, but it also handles well and accelerates nicely. Make sure you pick Quattro AWD and not FWD, but both engine options are solid:the V6 hits 0-60 in 5.2 seconds, but the turbo-4 holds its own and doesn't take away from the sporty handling or overall refinement. Audi's reliability has been rated among the best car brands for the past few years, and while long-term reliability is hard to predict, they're a lot better than they were 10-15 years ago by a long shot. Oh yeah, and the A6 is getting a redesign for 2019 that should make it even better.. But if you want to get a lot for your money from a refined, reliable, luxurious sports sedan, I have an interesting option for you:the Genesis G80 Sport. Genesis is Hyundai's new luxury brand, and what they've done is capture a lot of the performance and luxury from more expensive brands and offer it at a crazy good price. The G80 Sport trim comes with a twin-turbo V6 that moves the car from 0-60 in an impressive 5.0 seconds (despite the fact that it's actually bigger and more spacious than a GS, 5-series, or E-class). It also has an isolated interior with a surprisingly smooth ride quality and lots of standard equipment. It might not have the refinement or driving engagement of a Mercedes or BMW, but its price tag is what makes it such an awesome deal:$56k. That makes it faster, better handling, and more spaciousthan the Lexus GS350 F Sport for $5000 less, while still offering better than average reliability. Definitely worth a test drive!.

5273,pushpulllegz," I own an accord sport 2017 with the manual transmission. Its fun to daily(very roomy, comfy, looks good) but it's not the most exciting car. I test drove the CTV with paddle shifters and the car felt much slower and very boring tbh. IMO its a good buy with the 6MT, dont get the CVT..

5274,ftwin," I'm 90% set on getting a . 2018 Honda Accort Sport 2.0T.  in a few months.  Love how it looks, love the engine, super fun to drive. The interior is top notch and the tech is best i've ever seen in this class.. I just heard the . 2018 Mazda 6.  is getting a turbo this spring though so I'm thinking of checking this out before pulling the trigger on the Honda.  Only negatives here are that to get the same HP as the Honda on regular gas (250hp), you need to put premium in the Mazda.  I'm literally getting out of my Acura lease because i'm sick of getting premium gas so this might be a dealbreaker.  Also the lack of Apple Carplay is a big deal..

5275,IKnowNewCars," For me, the deal breaker between the two would be that the Accord Sport 2.0T comes with a manual transmission option and the Mazda 6 2.5T won't. If you're going automatic, that doesn't matter, but regardless, the 2018 Accord feels awesome to drive. The Mazda 6 has had an edge on it in regards to sporty handling for the past few years, but without thoroughly testing out the new turbo model, I can't say for sure how awesome it will be.. Honestly, if the premium gas thing bothers you and you've liked everything else about the Accord Sport 2.0T, go for it! Best mid-size sedan right now, in my opinion..
